  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What was the third initial symptom of the patient (if applicable)?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nFor patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A', the \"Clinical Presentation\" section on page 3 states: \"Patient AII-11 was a 77-year-old man who developed right upper limb rest tremor at age 62.\" This is presented as the initial symptom.\n\nThe text further states: \"At age 75, he underwent gastrostomy for progressive dysphagia, then developed cognitive dysfunction without hallucination.\" These symptoms occurred much later (13 years after onset) and are not described as initial symptoms.\n\nTable 2 lists several clinical features for patient AII-11, including \"Resting tremor,\" \"Bradykinesia,\" \"Rigidity,\" \"Gait disturbance,\" and \"Postural instability,\" all marked with a \"+\". It also notes \"Asymmetry at onset: +\".\n\nWhile \"right upper limb rest tremor\" is clearly identified as the symptom he developed at onset (the first initial symptom), the document does not provide a chronological order for any other *initial* symptoms that might have occurred at or around the same time (age 62) to identify a second or third initial symptom. Table 2 lists features present during his disease but does not specify their order of appearance *at the initial onset* beyond the tremor.\n\nTherefore, the third initial symptom is not specified.\n\nInformation not found"
