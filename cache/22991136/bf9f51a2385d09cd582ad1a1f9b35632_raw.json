  "raw_answer": "Based only on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document does not specify a \"third mutation\" for patient 'AII-11'. Patient 'AII-11' from 'Family A' was found to have the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene. The paper states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\n\nRegarding functional evidence for the p.D620N mutation (assuming this is the mutation in question for AII-11):\nThe document discusses a potential functional impact of the p.D620N mutation, stating on page 4: \"The p.D620N mutation of VPS35 might cause impairment of interaction with other components of the retromer complex and impaired retrograde trafficking of recycling proteins... Mutations in familial PD genes, including VPS35, may cause disruption of intracellular trafficking and lead to neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that impairment of intracellular trafficking systems is associated with the pathogenesis of PD.\"\n\nHowever, the same paragraph concludes: \"Although the association between the p.D620N mutation of VPS35 and PD remains unknown, further functional studies might shed light on the pathogenesis.\"\n\nThis indicates that while a potential mechanism is discussed, the document itself does not provide established functional evidence for the p.D620N mutation but rather points to the need for further studies to understand its functional role in PD. The document cites previous reports (refs 3, 4, 6) that identified p.D620N as pathogenic but does not detail the specific functional evidence from those reports.\n\nTherefore, specific, confirmed functional evidence from experiments or detailed established mechanisms supporting the pathogenicity of the mutation found in patient 'AII-11' is not provided *within this document* beyond hypotheses requiring further investigation.\n\nGiven this, the most accurate answer is:\nInformation not found.",
