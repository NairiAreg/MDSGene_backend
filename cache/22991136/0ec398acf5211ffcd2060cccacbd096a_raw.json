  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': Is this patient the index case in the family?",
  "context": "Based on the information in Figure 1 (page 3), specifically the pedigree for \"Family A\" (labeled \"A\"):\n\nThe caption for Figure 1 states: \"arrow, proband\". \"Proband\" is another term for index case.\nIn pedigree A, the arrow points to individual III-5.\nPatient AII-11 does not have an arrow pointing to them.\n\nTherefore, patient AII-11 is not the index case in Family A."
