  "context": "Based on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nTable 2 on page 3 lists \"Clinical features of patients with p.D620N mutation\", including patient \"AII-11\". The features listed for AII-11 are:\n*   Age at disease onset (y): 62\n*   Disease duration (y): 15\n*   Resting tremor: +\n*   Bradykinesia: +\n*   Rigidity: +\n*   Gait disturbance: +\n*   Postural instability: +\n*   Clinical response to levodopa: +\n*   Wearing off: +\n*   Asymmetry at onset: +\n*   Orthostatic hypotension: +\n*   Incontinence: +\n*   Urinary urgency: +\n*   Levodopa-induced dyskinesia: +\n*   Sleep benefit: +\n*   Dystonia at onset: -\n*   Hyperreflexia: -\n*   Hallucination: -\n*   Other psychosis: -\n*   Dementia: -\n*   Gaze palsy: -\n*   Brain MRI: WNL\n*   Cardiac MIBG scintigraphy: H/M ratio (E/L), 2.38/2.68; washout ratio, 4.15%\n\nThe text description for patient AII-11 on page 3 states: \"Patient AII-11 was a 77-year-old man who developed right upper limb rest tremor at age 62. At age 75, he underwent gastrostomy for progressive dysphagia, then developed cognitive dysfunction without hallucination.\"\n\nThe document does not explicitly state whether patient AII-11 has depression. While \"Other psychosis\" is listed as negative, depression is a distinct condition and is not specifically mentioned as being present or absent for patient AII-11. On page 4, the document mentions, \"Psychiatric problems were inconspicuous\" for their group of patients with VPS35 mutation, but this is a general statement and not specific to AII-11 having or not having depression.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nInformation not found"
