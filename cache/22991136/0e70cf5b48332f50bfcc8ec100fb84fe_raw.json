  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What genetic methods were used in this study?",
  "context": "Based on the information contained within the provided document, the following genetic methods were used in this study relevant to patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B' (who was found to have the p.D620N mutation):\n\n1.  **Screening for VPS35 variants:** Patient BIII-8, as an Autosomal Dominant Parkinson's Disease (ADPD) patient, was screened for 7 reported nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35 (including p.D620N) by \"direct sequencing or high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis.\" (Abstract; Page 2, \"Genetic Analysis\")\n2.  **Haplotype analysis:** \"Haplotype analysis of the VPS35 flanking region was performed\" for patients with the p.D620N mutation, which included patient BIII-8. (Page 2, \"Genetic Analysis\"; Page 3, Table 1)\n3.  **Analysis of all exons of VPS35:** For patients carrying the p.D620N mutation (like BIII-8), \"All exons of VPS35 were also analyzed\". (Page 2, \"Genetic Analysis\"; Page 3, \"Results\") The document states this was done \"using the method described previously.Â³\", but does not detail this specific method for full exon analysis within the provided text itself."
