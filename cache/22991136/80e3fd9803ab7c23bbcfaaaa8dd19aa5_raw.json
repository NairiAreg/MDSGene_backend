  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nPatient BIII-8 from Family B was found to have the p.D620N mutation in the **VPS35** gene (Table 1, page 3, and Figure 1B, page 3).\n\nThe text on page 3, under \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation,\" states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" This refers to other variants within the *same* gene, VPS35.\n\nThe document focuses primarily on VPS35 mutations. While it mentions on page 2 (\"Genetic Analysis\") that \"Some of the selected subjects had been confirmed negative for SNCA, PARK2, PINK1, PARK7, LRRK2, and PLA2G6 mutations,\" it does not specify that patient BIII-8 was among those screened for these additional genes, nor does it state that BIII-8 had a pathogenic variant in any gene other than VPS35.\n\nTherefore, based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, there is no mention of a second gene with a pathogenic variant found in patient BIII-8.\n\nInformation not found",
