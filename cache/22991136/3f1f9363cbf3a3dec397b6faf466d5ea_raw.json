  "raw_answer": "Based only on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document identifies patient 'AII-11' from 'Family A' (Fig. 1A, Table 1, Table 2). Table 1 (\"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\") indicates that patient 'AII-11' has the 'VPS35 p.D620N' mutation. This is the first and only mutation explicitly linked to this patient in the document.\n\nThe document discusses the frequency of the p.D620N mutation in the study's population (e.g., \"In our population, the incidence of the p.D620N mutation was 1.0% (3 of 300) in ADPD and 0.23% (1 of 433) in SPD.\" - page 3) and compares it to frequencies in \"other populations\" or \"previous studies\" in a general sense (e.g., \"relatively higher in Japanese than reported in other populations\" - abstract; \"frequency is relatively higher in Japanese patients compared with that reported in previous studies (0%â€“1.22%)\" - page 4).\n\nHowever, the document does **not** contain any information regarding the \"gnomAD v4.0.0 frequency\" for this or any other mutation. The gnomAD database, especially version 4.0.0, would not have been available or cited in a paper published in 2012.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nInformation not found.",
