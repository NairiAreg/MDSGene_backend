  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document states on page 3, in the first paragraph under Figure 1: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\n\nPatient BIII-8 is identified as carrying the p.D620N mutation (Fig 1B, Table 1, Table 2). Therefore, according to this document, no second mutation protein change in VPS35 was found for patient BIII-8. The document does not provide information about mutations in other genes for this patient.\n\nThus, regarding a \"Second mutation protein change\" for patient 'BIII-8', the information is not found in the document (as no second mutation was identified).\n\nInformation not found",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': Second mutation protein change?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': Second mutation protein change?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
