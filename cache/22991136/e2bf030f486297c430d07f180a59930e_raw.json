  "context": "Based on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nPatient BIII-8 from Family B is a carrier of the VPS35 p.D620N mutation (Table 1 shows BIII-8 with genotype \"A/G\" for \"VPS35 p.D620N\", indicating heterozygosity).\n\nOn page 3, in the \"Results\" section, under \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\", the document states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\n\nThis indicates that for patients like BIII-8 who have the p.D620N mutation, no *second* mutation within the VPS35 gene was found. The document does not provide information about any second mutation in any other gene for patient BIII-8.\n\nTherefore, the genotype of a second mutation for patient BIII-8 is:\n\nInformation not found"
