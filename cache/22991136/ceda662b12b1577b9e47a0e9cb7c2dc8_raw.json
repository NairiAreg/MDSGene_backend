  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nThe study design involved screening for specific genetic mutations (7 reported nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35, including p.D620N) in defined groups of individuals. These groups were:\n1.  300 Japanese index patients with autosomal dominant Parkinson's Disease (ADPD).\n2.  433 Japanese patients with sporadic Parkinson's Disease (SPD).\n3.  579 control subjects (healthy Japanese subjects without a family history of parkinsonism).\n\nThe screening was performed using direct sequencing or high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. The aim was \"to determine the incidence and clinical features of Asian PD patients with VPS35 mutations.\" Haplotype analysis was also performed on patients with the p.D620N mutation.\n\nThis can be described as a **genetic screening study** with a **case-control design** component (comparing PD patients to controls to determine mutation frequencies).",
