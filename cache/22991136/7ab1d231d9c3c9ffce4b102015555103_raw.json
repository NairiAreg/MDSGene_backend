  "raw_answer": "The genomic-level notation for the mutation in patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C' is c.1858G>A.\n\nThis is derived from:\n1.  Page 3, FIG. 1 shows patient CII-3 in family C. The legend states that asterisked individuals were analyzed for the p.D620N mutation.\n2.  Page 3, TABLE 1 confirms patient CII-3 carries the \"VPS35 p.D620N\" mutation with an \"A/G\" genotype, indicating heterozygosity.\n3.  Page 2, under \"Genetic Analysis\", states: \"...genotyped for c.1858G>A (p.D620N) mutation...\".\n4.  Page 2, left column, third paragraph, states: \"Mutation of c.1858G>A (p.D620N) was identified...\".\n5.  Page 3, in the paragraph below Figure 1, it states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" This implies this is the first (and only mentioned) mutation for this patient.",
