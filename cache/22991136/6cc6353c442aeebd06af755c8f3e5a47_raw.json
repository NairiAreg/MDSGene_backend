  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What was the third initial symptom of the patient (if applicable)?",
  "context": "Information not found.\n\nThe document states on page 3, \"Patients BIII-8 and CII-3 both developed upper limb rest tremor at ages 34 and 55, respectively.\" This identifies one initial symptom for CII-3. Table 2 on page 3 lists various clinical features for patient CII-3, including \"Resting tremor,\" \"Bradykinesia,\" \"Rigidity,\" etc., as present. However, the document does not provide a chronological order for the *initial* symptoms beyond the first mentioned (upper limb rest tremor) for patient CII-3."
