  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What functional evidence supports the pathogenicity of the third mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document mentions that patient CII-3 has the p.D620N mutation in VPS35 (Table 1, Page 3).\n\nOn page 4, the Discussion section states: \"The p.D620N mutation of VPS35 might cause impairment of interaction with other components of the retromer complex and impaired retrograde trafficking of recycling proteins... Mutations in familial PD genes, including VPS35, may cause disruption of intracellular trafficking and lead to neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that impairment of intracellular trafficking systems is associated with the pathogenesis of PD.\"\n\nHowever, this is a general statement about the *potential* mechanism of the p.D620N mutation based on the known function of VPS35 and its role in the retromer complex. The document itself does not present any *new experimental functional evidence* (e.g., cell-based assays, protein interaction studies, etc., performed as part of this specific study) to support the pathogenicity of the p.D620N mutation found in patient CII-3 or any of the other patients in this study. It further states, \"Although the association between the p.D620N mutation of VPS35 and PD remains unknown, further functional studies might shed light on the pathogenesis\".\n\nTherefore, based *only* on the information provided *within this document*, new functional evidence supporting the pathogenicity of the mutation in CII-3 is not detailed.\n\nInformation not found"
