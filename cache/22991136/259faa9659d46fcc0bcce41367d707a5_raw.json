  "raw_answer": "Information not found.\n\nReasoning:\n1.  The document identifies patient BIII-8 as carrying the heterozygous p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene (Table 1, page 3; Figure 1, page 3).\n2.  The document states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35\" (page 3, left column, paragraph 2). This indicates that for patients like BIII-8 with the p.D620N mutation, no other mutations *within the VPS35 gene* were identified by this study.\n3.  The question specifically asks about functional evidence supporting the pathogenicity of \"the second mutation\" in patient BIII-8. Since the document does not identify a \"second mutation\" for patient BIII-8 (at least within the VPS35 gene, which is the focus of the paper), it cannot provide functional evidence for the pathogenicity of such an unspecified second mutation for this patient.\n4.  While the paper discusses the potential functional impact of the p.D620N mutation in general (page 4, Discussion section, regarding impairment of the retromer complex and intracellular trafficking), this refers to the p.D620N mutation itself, not a \"second mutation\" in patient BIII-8.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What functional evidence supports the pathogenicity of the second mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What functional evidence supports the pathogenicity of the second mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
