  "raw_answer": "Information not found.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe document provides information about patient CII-3 from Family C:\n*   Figure 1C shows the pedigree for Family C. Patient CII-3 (II-3 in the pedigree) is marked with an asterisk, indicating they were \"analyzed for the p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype.\" CII-3 is shown as an affected individual (filled square).\n*   Table 1 shows haplotype analysis for patient CII-3, indicating they carry the p.D620N mutation heterozygously (A/G).\n*   Table 2 lists clinical features for patient CII-3, confirming they are affected.\n\nHowever, the question asks about *unaffected* individuals in Family C who have heterozygous mutations.\n*   In Pedigree C (Figure 1C), the unaffected individuals are I-1, II-1, and II-2.\n*   None of these unaffected individuals (I-1, II-1, II-2) in Family C are marked with an asterisk in Figure 1C. According to the figure legend, an asterisk denotes an \"individual analyzed for the p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype.\"\n\nSince the document only indicates that the affected individual CII-3 was analyzed from Family C, there is no information provided about the mutation status (heterozygous or otherwise) of the unaffected individuals in this family.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': How many unaffected individuals in the family have heterozygous mutations?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': How many unaffected individuals in the family have heterozygous mutations?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
