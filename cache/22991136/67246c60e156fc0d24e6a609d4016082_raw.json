  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What functional evidence supports the pathogenicity of the first mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, the functional evidence supporting the pathogenicity of the p.D620N mutation (the first and only mutation identified in patient BIII-8 from Family B) is described on page 4, in the Discussion section:\n\nThe document states: \"The p.D620N mutation of VPS35 might cause impairment of interaction with other components of the retromer complex and impaired retrograde trafficking of recycling proteins... Mutations in familial PD genes, including VPS35, may cause disruption of intracellular trafficking and lead to neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that impairment of intracellular trafficking systems is associated with the pathogenesis of PD.\"\n\nTherefore, the functional evidence is that the p.D620N mutation might:\n1.  Cause impairment of interaction with other components of the retromer complex.\n2.  Lead to impaired retrograde trafficking of recycling proteins.\n3.  Cause disruption of intracellular trafficking, which is associated with neurodegeneration and the pathogenesis of PD."
