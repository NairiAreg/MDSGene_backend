  "raw_answer": "The document lists 7 variants that were screened for in patients (Page 2, \"Genetic Analysis\" section):\n1.  p.M57I (exon 3)\n2.  p.I241M (exon 7)\n3.  **p.P316S (exon 9)**\n4.  p.R524W (exon 13)\n5.  p.D620N (exon 15)\n6.  p.A737V (exon 16)\n7.  p.L774M (exon 17)\n\nThe \"third variant\" in this list is p.P316S.\n\nThe question asks about this third variant specifically \"Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A'\".\n\nOn Page 3, the first paragraph of the \"Results\" section states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\nPatient AII-11 from Family A is stated to carry the p.D620N mutation (Page 3, Table 1 and accompanying text).\n\nFurthermore, the abstract states: \"None of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected.\" The \"other reported variants\" would include p.P316S, as p.D620N was the one detected in some patients.\nThis is reinforced on Page 2, \"Results\" section, which says: \"The remaining variants analyzed in this study were not identified in any patients.\" \"The remaining variants\" refers to the 6 variants other than p.D620N, which includes the third variant p.P316S.\n\nTherefore, patient AII-11 does not have the third variant (p.P316S). Since patient AII-11 does not have this variant, the document does not provide information on the type of this \"third variant\" *for this specific patient*.\n\nInformation not found",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What type of mutation is the third variant?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What type of mutation is the third variant?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
