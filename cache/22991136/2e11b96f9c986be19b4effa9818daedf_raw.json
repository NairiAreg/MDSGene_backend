  "raw_answer": "Based only on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nRegarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C':\n\n*   Patient CII-3 is an affected individual with the VPS35 p.D620N mutation (Figure 1C, Table 1, Table 2).\n*   Clinically, patient CII-3 developed upper limb rest tremor at age 34. At the time of the study, the disease duration was 7 years. Specific clinical features are detailed in Table 2, including a positive response to levodopa, the presence of wearing off, and asymmetry at onset. Brain MRI was within normal limits, and cardiac MIBG scintigraphy was not performed (Table 2, Page 3).\n*   The father of patient CII-3 also developed Parkinson's Disease (PD) (Figure 1C, Page 4). Patient CII-3 was born to nonconsanguineous parents (Page 4).\n*   Haplotype analysis data for patient CII-3 is presented in Table 1. The table notes that for this patient, \"Both alleles are shown when markers of phase could not be determined.\"\n*   The document states that patient CII-3 had a different genotype of D16S3105 (a microsatellite locus very close to VPS35) compared with the disease allele of patient AII-11 from Family A (Page 3).\n*   The p.D620N mutation in patient CII-3 (Family C) is thought to have probably occurred independently from that in Family A or patient D. Families A and C did not have the same alleles for the D16S3105 microsatellite, suggesting at least 3 different haplotypes for the p.D620N mutation in Japanese patients (Page 4).\n*   The document also mentions that to determine the chromosomal phase of Family C (which includes CII-3), detailed genetic analyses of other family members would be needed in future studies (Page 4).",
