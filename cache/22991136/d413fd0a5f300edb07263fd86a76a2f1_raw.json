  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\n1.  **Patient BIII-8:** Figure 1B shows patient BIII-8 (proband, arrow, filled symbol) as an affected individual in Family B. Table 1 (\"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\") lists BIII-8 and indicates their \"VPS35 p.D620N\" status as \"A/G\", meaning BIII-8 is a carrier of the mutation and is affected.\n\n2.  **Other Affected Individuals in Family B:**\n    *   Figure 1B shows three other affected individuals in generation II: II-2 (mother of BIII-8), II-4, and II-6 (aunts of BIII-8). All are represented by filled circles.\n    *   The legend for Figure 1 states: \"asterisk, individual analyzed for the p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype\". Individuals II-2, II-4, and II-6 in Family B are all marked with an asterisk. This means they were analyzed for the p.D620N mutation.\n    *   The text on page 3, under \"Clinical Presentation\", states: \"The mother and aunts of patient BIII-8 ... also developed PD (Fig. 1B, C).\" This confirms these individuals are affected.\n\n3.  **Mutation Status of II-2, II-4, and II-6:**\n    *   Table 1 is titled \"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers.\" This table lists individuals who were found to carry the p.D620N mutation and for whom haplotype analysis was performed.\n    *   The affected individuals II-2, II-4, and II-6 from Family B, despite being analyzed for the p.D620N mutation (as indicated by the asterisks in Figure 1B), are *not* listed in Table 1.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since individuals II-2, II-4, and II-6 from Family B are affected with PD, were analyzed for the p.D620N mutation, and are not listed among the \"p.D620N mutation carriers\" in Table 1, the information provided implies that these three affected individuals do not carry the p.D620N mutation. Therefore, with respect to the p.D620N mutation, they are considered wildtype.\n\nThus, there are 3 affected individuals in Family B (II-2, II-4, and II-6) who have wildtype status for the p.D620N mutation.\n\nAnswer: 3",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': How many affected individuals in the family have wildtype (no mutations)?",
