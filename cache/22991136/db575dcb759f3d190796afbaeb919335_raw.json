  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': Which human genome version was used for variant reporting?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document mentions in the \"Genetic Analysis\" section (page 2):\n\"Patients with ADPD and SPD were examined for the following 7 variants: p.M57I (exon 3), p.I241M (exon 7), p.P316S (exon 9), p.R524W (exon 13), p.D620N (exon 15), p.A737V (exon 16), and p.L774M (exon 17) of VPS35 (RefSeq accession number NM_018206.4).\"\n\nThis indicates that the RefSeq accession number NM_018206.4 was used as the reference sequence for the VPS35 gene variants. However, NM_018206.4 is a transcript reference sequence, not a \"human genome version\" (which typically refers to a specific assembly like hg19, GRCh37, GRCh38, etc.).\n\nTable 1, \"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers,\" lists microsatellite markers with chromosomal coordinates (e.g., \"Chr16_45.333M\"). These coordinates would be based on a specific human genome assembly version. However, the document does not explicitly state which human genome assembly version these coordinates refer to.\n\nTherefore, the specific human genome version used for variant reporting (in the sense of a genome-wide assembly like hg19 or GRCh37) is not explicitly stated in the document.\n\nInformation not found."
