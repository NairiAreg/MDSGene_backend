  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the document, the study design is as follows:\n\nThe study aimed to determine the incidence and clinical features of Asian Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients with VPS35 mutations. To do this, the researchers:\n1.  Screened 7 reported nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35 (including p.D620N) in 300 Japanese index patients with autosomal dominant PD (this group included patient 'AII-11' from 'Family A') and 433 patients with sporadic PD. This screening was performed using direct sequencing or high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis.\n2.  Screened 579 control subjects for the p.D620N mutation by HRM analysis.\n3.  Conducted haplotype analysis on patients found to have the p.D620N mutation.\n4.  Described the clinical features of the patients with the VPS35 mutation.\n\nTherefore, the study design is a genetic screening study of patient cohorts (autosomal dominant PD, sporadic PD) and a control group to identify specific gene mutations, followed by genetic (haplotype) analysis and clinical characterization of mutation carriers.",
