  "raw_answer": "Haplotype analysis showed that patient CII-3 had a different genotype of D16S3105 (a locus very close to VPS35) compared with the disease allele of patient AII-11 (from Family A). This suggests that the p.D620N mutation in patient CII-3 (Family C) probably occurred independently. Family C did not have the same alleles for the D16S3105 microsatellite as Family A and patient D.",
  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': Any additional comments about this patient?",
  "context": "Patient CII-3 from Family C developed upper limb rest tremor at age 34. The father of patient CII-3 also developed PD. Haplotype analysis showed that patient CII-3 had a different genotype of D16S3105 (a locus very close to VPS35) compared with the disease allele of patient AII-11 (from Family A). This suggests that the p.D620N mutation in patient CII-3 (Family C) probably occurred independently. Family C did not have the same alleles for the D16S3105 microsatellite as Family A and patient D."
