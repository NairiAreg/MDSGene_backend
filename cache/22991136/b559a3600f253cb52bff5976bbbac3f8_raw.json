  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the upper age limit for study inclusion (if any)?",
  "context": "Based on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nOn page 2, in the \"Patients and Methods\" section, under \"Subjects,\" the text states:\n\"The study subjects were 308 Japanese patients (300 index patients) with ADPD (age at disease onset [AAO; mean ± SD], 51.1 ± 11.7 years; **range, 8-83 years**; female/male [F/M] ratio, 1.35)...\"\n\nPatient 'AII-11' from 'Family A' is described as an ADPD (autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease) patient (as indicated by the pedigree in Figure 1A and the clinical details). Therefore, the age characteristics for the ADPD patient group apply.\n\nThe upper limit of the age at disease onset for ADPD patients included in this study was 83 years.\n\nThus, the upper age limit for study inclusion, specifically referring to the age at disease onset for ADPD patients like AII-11, is 83 years.\n\nAnswer: 83 years (for age at disease onset)"
