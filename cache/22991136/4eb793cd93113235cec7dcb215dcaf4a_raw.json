  "raw_answer": "The document states on page 2, in the \"Genetic Analysis\" section: \"SPD patients and control subjects were also genotyped for c.1858G>A (p.D620N) mutation...\".\n\nThe notation c.1858G>A indicates that the reference allele at position 1858 is G, which is mutated to A in the affected individuals. Patient AII-11 is confirmed to have the p.D620N mutation (Table 1, page 3).\n\nTherefore, the reference allele for the first (and only mentioned) mutation, p.D620N (c.1858G>A), is G.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the reference allele for the first mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the reference allele for the first mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
