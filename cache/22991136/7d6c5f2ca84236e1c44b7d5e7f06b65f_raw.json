  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': Does the patient have sleep disorders?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nTable 2 on page 3 (\"Clinical features of patients with p.D620N mutation\") lists clinical features for patient CII-3. One of the features listed is \"Sleep benefit,\" for which patient CII-3 has a \"+\" sign, indicating its presence.\n\nHowever, \"sleep benefit\" is a phenomenon where Parkinson's disease symptoms improve after sleep; it is not classified as a \"sleep disorder\" itself (such as insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder, sleep apnea, etc.). The table does not provide any other information about CII-3 having any specific sleep disorders.\n\nTherefore, the document states that patient CII-3 experiences \"sleep benefit,\" but it does not explicitly state whether the patient has \"sleep disorders.\"\n\nInformation not found."
