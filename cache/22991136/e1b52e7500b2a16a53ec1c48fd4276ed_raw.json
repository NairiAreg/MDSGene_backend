  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the observed (mutant) allele for the first mutation?",
  "context": "On page 3, Table 1 (\"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\") provides information for patient CII-3. For the \"VPS35 p.D620N\" row, the entry for CII-3 is \"A/G\".\n\nOn page 2, under \"Genetic Analysis\", the text states: \"...genotyped for c.1858G>A (p.D620N) mutation...\". This indicates that the p.D620N mutation corresponds to a change from G to A at nucleotide position c.1858.\n\nTherefore, the mutant allele is 'A'.\n\nA"
