  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document states the following about patient 'AII-11' from 'Family A':\n1.  Patient AII-11 has the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene (Figure 1A legend indicates AII-11 was analyzed; Table 1 shows patient AII-11 as a carrier of the VPS35 p.D620N mutation with allele 'A'; Page 3 states \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD\", and AII-11 is the proband of Family A, one of these families).\n2.  On page 3, first paragraph, it is stated: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" This applies to patient AII-11.\n3.  The study screened for 7 reported nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35. The abstract says: \"None of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected.\" Page 3, first paragraph, also states: \"The remaining variants ana-lyzed in this study were not identified in any patients.\" This refers to the 6 variants other than p.D620N that were screened.\n\nThe question asks for the \"observed (mutant) allele for the *third* mutation\" in patient 'AII-11'.\nAccording to the document, patient 'AII-11' was found to have only one mutation in the VPS35 gene (p.D620N) and no other variants in all exons of VPS35. Therefore, there is no information about a \"second\" or \"third\" mutation for patient 'AII-11' in the VPS35 gene.\n\nIf \"the third mutation\" refers to the third mutation on the list of 7 variants screened by the researchers (listed on page 2, \"Genetic Analysis\": 1. p.M571, 2. p.I241M, 3. p.P316S), then the third mutation on this list is p.P316S. The document states that this variant (and others apart from p.D620N) was \"not identified in any patients,\" which includes patient AII-11. Thus, if p.P316S is \"the third mutation\" in this context, it was not observed in patient AII-11, and therefore there is no \"observed (mutant) allele\" for it in this patient.\n\nSince the document explicitly states that only one mutation (p.D620N) was found in patient AII-11 within the VPS35 gene, and no other variants were detected, there is no information provided about a \"third mutation\" for this specific patient.\n\nTherefore, the information is not found in the document.\n\nInformation not found.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the observed (mutant) allele for the third mutation?",
