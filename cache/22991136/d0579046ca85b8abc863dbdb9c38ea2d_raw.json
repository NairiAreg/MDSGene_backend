  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What is the genotype of the first mutation?",
  "context": "The document provides information about mutations in the VPS35 gene. The question asks for the genotype of the first mutation for patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B'.\n\n1.  **Identify Patient and Family:** Patient 'BIII-8' from 'Family B' is mentioned in the document. Figure 1 (page 3) shows the pedigree for Family B, and individual BIII-8 is marked with an asterisk, indicating they were analyzed.\n\n2.  **Locate Mutation Information:** The paper focuses on the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene.\n    *   Page 2, under \"Results - Detection of p.D620N Mutation\", states: \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD and 1 patient with SPD (Fig. 1).\"\n    *   Page 3, Table 1, titled \"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\", lists patient BIII-8.\n\n3.  **Find Genotype in Table 1:** Table 1 (page 3) shows data for patient BIII-8.\n    *   The row relevant to the mutation is labeled \"VPS35 p.D620N\".\n    *   Under the column for patient \"BIII-8\", the entry for \"VPS35 p.D620N\" is \"A/G\".\n\n4.  **Interpret the Genotype:** The mutation is c.1858G>A (p.D620N), as stated on page 2. This means the wild-type nucleotide is G, and the mutant nucleotide is A. The genotype \"A/G\" for patient BIII-8 indicates that this patient is heterozygous for this mutation, having one mutant allele (A) and one wild-type allele (G) at this position. The paper confirms on page 3 that \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35,\" so p.D620N is the specific mutation being referred to.\n\nTherefore, based on Table 1, the genotype of the p.D620N mutation for patient BIII-8 is A/G.\n\nA/G"
