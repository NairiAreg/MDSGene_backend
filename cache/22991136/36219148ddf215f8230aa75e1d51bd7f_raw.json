  "context": "To answer the question regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': \"How many unaffected individuals in the family have wildtype (no mutations)?\", we need to find information in the document about unaffected members of Family A whose genotype has been determined as wildtype.\n\n1.  **Identify Family A and patient AII-11:** Figure 1A on page 3 shows the pedigree for Family A. Patient AII-11 is the proband (indicated by an arrow) and is affected (closed symbol). He has an asterisk, indicating he was \"analyzed for the p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype.\"\n\n2.  **Identify unaffected individuals in Family A who were analyzed:**\n    *   Unaffected individuals are represented by open symbols (squares for males, circles for females).\n    *   Individuals analyzed for the mutation are marked with an asterisk (*).\n    *   In Family A (Figure 1A), the following individuals are unaffected (open symbols): I-1, I-2 (parents, deceased), II-2, II-3, II-5, II-12, II-13 (siblings or spouses of siblings of AII-11), and all individuals in generation III.\n    *   Among these unaffected individuals, only **AII-12** (an open circle, female) has an asterisk, indicating she was analyzed.\n\n3.  **Determine if AII-12 is wildtype based on the document:**\n    *   AII-12 is an unaffected sister of the proband AII-11. She was analyzed for the p.D620N mutation.\n    *   The document does not explicitly state the result of the genetic analysis for AII-12 (i.e., whether she carries the p.D620N mutation or is wildtype).\n    *   On page 4, the document mentions: \"With regard to VPS35 mutation penetrance, it is incomplete from the results of a previous report.4\" This means that an individual carrying the mutation might not show symptoms of the disease. Therefore, an unaffected individual who has been analyzed (like AII-12) could potentially carry the mutation and be a non-penetrant carrier.\n    *   Table 1 on page 3 is titled \"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\" and lists patients AII-11, BIII-8, CII-3, and D. AII-12 is not listed in this table of mutation carriers. While this might suggest she is not a carrier, it is not explicit proof of wildtype status provided elsewhere.\n    *   The document does not contain a statement such as \"AII-12 was found to be wildtype\" or \"AII-12 did not carry the familial p.D620N mutation.\"\n\n4.  **Conclusion on other unaffected individuals:** Other unaffected individuals in Family A (e.g., II-2, II-3, II-5, II-13, members of generation III) do not have an asterisk, meaning they were not analyzed for the mutation according to the figure legend. Therefore, their genotype (wildtype or carrier) cannot be determined from the document.\n\nSince the specific genotype (wildtype or carrier of the p.D620N mutation) of the only analyzed unaffected individual in Family A (AII-12) is not explicitly stated, and given the mentioned incomplete penetrance of VPS35 mutations, we cannot definitively determine from the provided document how many unaffected individuals in Family A have wildtype (no mutations).\n\nInformation not found."
