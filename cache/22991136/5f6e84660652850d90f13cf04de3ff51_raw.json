  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What is the lower age limit for study inclusion (if any)?",
  "context": "On page 2, under the \"Subjects\" section of \"Patients and Methods\", it states:\n\"The study subjects were 308 Japanese patients (300 index patients) with ADPD (age at disease onset [AAO; mean ± SD], 51.1 ± 11.7 years; range, 8-83 years; female/male [F/M] ratio, 1.35)...\"\n\nPatient BIII-8 is from Family B, which is described as a family with the VPS35 p.D620N mutation (Fig. 1, page 3). The abstract and results indicate that patients with this mutation were found among those with autosomal dominant PD (ADPD).\n\nTherefore, for patients with ADPD, the age at disease onset range for inclusion in the study was 8-83 years. The lower age limit for study inclusion, based on age at disease onset, was 8 years.\n\nAnswer: 8 years (based on age at disease onset for ADPD patients)."
