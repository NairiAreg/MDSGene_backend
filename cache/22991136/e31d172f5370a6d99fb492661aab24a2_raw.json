  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document states on page 4, in the Discussion section: \"The p.D620N mutation of VPS35 might cause impairment of interaction with other components of the retromer complex and impaired retrograde trafficking of recycling proteins, similar to Î±-synuclein and LRRK2, which are involved in vesicle trafficking. Mutations in familial PD genes, including VPS35, may cause disruption of intracellular trafficking and lead to neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that impairment of intracellular trafficking systems is associated with the pathogenesis of PD.\"\n\nTherefore, the functional evidence suggested by the document that supports the pathogenicity of the p.D620N mutation (which patient BIII-8 has) is that it might cause impairment of interaction with other components of the retromer complex and impaired retrograde trafficking of recycling proteins, leading to disruption of intracellular trafficking and neurodegeneration.",
