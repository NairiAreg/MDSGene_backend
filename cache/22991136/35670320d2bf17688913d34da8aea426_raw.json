  "raw_answer": "The document states on page 3: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\n\nPatient CII-3 is listed in Table 1 (page 3) as having the VPS35 p.D620N mutation with a genotype of A/G.\n\nSince patients with the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in VPS35, there is no information about a \"second\" or \"third\" mutation in the VPS35 gene for patient CII-3. The study screened for 7 variants (page 2, \"Genetic Analysis\"), but only p.D620N was detected in any patient (Abstract: \"None of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected.\"; Page 3: \"The remaining variants analyzed in this study were not identified in any patients.\").\n\nTherefore, information about a \"third mutation\" for patient CII-3 is not found in the document.\n\nInformation not found",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the genotype of the third mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the genotype of the third mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
