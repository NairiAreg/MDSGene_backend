  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the reference allele for the third mutation?",
  "context": "The document provides information about patient 'CII-3' from 'Family C'.\nAccording to Figure 1 (page 3), patient CII-3 is an affected individual in Family C.\nTable 1 (page 3) shows haplotype analysis for patient CII-3. For \"VPS35 p.D620N\", the genotype of patient CII-3 is listed as \"A/G\". This indicates that patient CII-3 is heterozygous for the p.D620N mutation.\nThe text on page 2, under \"Genetic Analysis\", states that the p.D620N mutation corresponds to c.1858G>A. In this notation, 'G' is the reference allele and 'A' is the variant allele.\n\nThe question asks for the \"reference allele for the third mutation\" for patient CII-3.\nOn page 3, under \"Results - Detection of p.D620N Mutation\", the document states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\nSince patient CII-3 is a carrier of the p.D620N mutation (as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1), this statement implies that, according to this study's findings for the VPS35 gene, patient CII-3 has only one mutation (p.D620N) and no other variants in the exons of VPS35.\n\nTherefore, the document does not provide information about a \"second\" or \"third\" mutation for patient CII-3 in the VPS35 gene. It states that only the p.D620N mutation was found in this patient within the screened regions of VPS35.\n\nIf the question implies there are multiple mutations for patient CII-3 and asks about the third one, the document contradicts this by stating no other variants were found in VPS35 for patients with p.D620N. Thus, based *only* on the information in the document, there is no \"third mutation\" described for patient CII-3.\n\nInformation not found."
