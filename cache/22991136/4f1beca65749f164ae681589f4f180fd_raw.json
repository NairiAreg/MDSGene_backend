  "raw_answer": "The standardized alias for the first mutation for patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C' is **p.D620N**.\n\nThis is supported by:\n1.  Figure 1C shows patient II-3 (CII-3) as an asterisked individual, indicating analysis for the p.D620N mutation.\n2.  Table 1 lists \"CII-3\" under \"Patient ID\" as a \"VPS35 p.D620N mutation carrier\".\n3.  The text on page 3 states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" This implies that p.D620N is the specific mutation found and, in this context, the only one discussed for this patient in the VPS35 gene.\n4.  The text on page 4, Discussion, states: \"...the same p.D620N mutation probably occurred independently in patient CII-3 (family C)...\"",
