  "raw_answer": "The document provides information about patient 'BIII-8' from 'Family B'.\n\n1.  **Identification of Patient and Family**: Figure 1B on page 3 shows the pedigree for Family B, and patient BIII-8 is marked with an asterisk, indicating they were analyzed.\n\n2.  **Mutation in Patient BIII-8**:\n    *   Table 1 on page 3 (\"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\") lists patient BIII-8. For the marker \"VPS35 p.D620N\", patient BIII-8 has the genotype \"A/G\".\n    *   The mutation is described as c.1858G>A (p.D620N) (page 2, \"Genetic Analysis\" section mentions c.1858G>A (p.D620N); Table 1 caption refers to p.D620N). This means the 'G' allele is the reference (wild-type) and the 'A' allele is the mutant allele causing the p.D620N change.\n    *   Therefore, patient BIII-8 is heterozygous for the p.D620N mutation. This p.D620N mutation is a missense mutation (Abstract: \"nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35, including p.D620N\"; Page 2 Results: \"heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation\").\n\n3.  **Search for a \"Second Variant\" that is a Mutation**:\n    *   The question asks for the \"type of mutation\" of the \"second variant\" in patient BIII-8.\n    *   The document states on page 3, in the first paragraph of the \"Results\" section: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" Patient BIII-8 is one of the patients carrying the p.D620N mutation.\n    *   This statement indicates that no other variants (and therefore no other mutations) were found in any of the exons of the VPS35 gene for patient BIII-8, aside from the p.D620N mutation.\n\nSince the document explicitly states that patients with the p.D620N mutation (like BIII-8) do not have any other variants in the exons of VPS35, there is no \"second variant\" that is a mutation described for this patient in the VPS35 gene. If the \"second variant\" refers to the other allele at the p.D620N locus (which is 'G', the wild-type allele), it is not a mutation and thus does not have a \"type of mutation\".\n\nTherefore, based only on the information in the document, the type of mutation for a \"second variant\" in patient BIII-8 cannot be determined because the document indicates no such second mutation in VPS35 exists for this patient.\n\nInformation not found.",
