  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'D': What is the second gene with a pathogenic variant found in the patient (if any)?",
  "context": "Patient D has the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene (Table 2 title: \"Clinical features of patients with p.D620N mutation\"; Page 4, left column: \"Patient D, who developed upper limb rest tremor at age 42...\").\n\nThe document states on page 3, under \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\": \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" This indicates no other variants were found *within the VPS35 gene* for these patients, including patient D.\n\nThe question asks for a *second gene* with a pathogenic variant. The document does mention that \"Some of the selected subjects had been confirmed negative for SNCA, PARK2, PINK1, PARK7, LRRK2, and PLA2G6 mutations\" (Page 2, \"Subjects\"). However, it does not specify if Patient D was among this group, nor does it state that Patient D was found to have a pathogenic variant in any other gene.\n\nTherefore, based only on the information provided, there is no mention of a second gene with a pathogenic variant found in patient D.\n\nInformation not found"
