At age 75, he underwent gastrostomy for progressive dysphagia, then developed cognitive dysfunction without hallucination. Single-photon emission computed tomography of cerebral blood flow showed no reduction in blood flow in the basal ganglia. (Page 3)\n*   MIBG scintigraphy was performed when AII-11 was 76 years old.
