  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nPatient CII-3 from Family C is shown in Figure 1C and Table 1.\n1.  Figure 1C shows two affected individuals in Family C: I-1 (father) and CII-3 (proband).\n2.  Table 1 (\"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\") indicates that patient CII-3 has the \"VPS35 p.D620N\" mutation as \"A/G\". This signifies a heterozygous mutation.\n3.  The text on page 3 states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" This implies CII-3, who carries the heterozygous p.D620N mutation, does not have other (including homozygous) variants in VPS35.\n4.  Figure 1C indicates that individual I-1 (the affected father of CII-3) is *not* marked with an asterisk. The figure legend states: \"asterisk, individual analyzed for the p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype\". Therefore, there is no genetic information provided in the document for individual I-1 of Family C.\n\nSince the genetic status regarding mutations (homozygous or otherwise) for one of the two affected individuals in Family C (I-1) is not provided in the document, we cannot determine the total number of affected individuals in Family C who have homozygous mutations.\n\nInformation not found.",

  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': How many affected individuals in the family have homozygous mutations?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
