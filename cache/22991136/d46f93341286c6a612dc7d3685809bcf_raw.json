  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the document:\n\n1.  Patient AII-11 from Family A is an *affected* individual (Fig. 1A shows a filled symbol for AII-11, and Table 2 lists clinical features for patient AII-11).\n2.  In Family A (Fig. 1A), individuals AII-12 (female) and AII-13 (male) are marked with an asterisk, indicating they were \"analyzed for the p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype\". They are represented by open symbols, meaning they are unaffected.\n3.  The document states on page 3: \"One disease allele was detected by analyzing patient AII-11 and his relatives.\" However, it does not specify the results of the genetic analysis for the unaffected relatives AII-12 and AII-13 (i.e., whether they carry the heterozygous p.D620N mutation or not). The focus is on the affected individuals.\n\nTherefore, the document does not state how many *unaffected* individuals in Family A have heterozygous mutations.\n\nInformation not found",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': How many unaffected individuals in the family have heterozygous mutations?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': How many unaffected individuals in the family have heterozygous mutations?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
