  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What is the observed (mutant) allele for the third mutation?",
  "context": "The document describes a study that screened for 7 specific nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35 in Japanese patients. These variants are listed in the \"Genetic Analysis\" section on page 2:\n1.  p.M57I (exon 3)\n2.  p.I241M (exon 7)\n3.  **p.P316S (exon 9)**\n4.  p.R524W (exon 13)\n5.  p.D620N (exon 15)\n6.  p.A737V (exon 16)\n7.  p.L774M (exon 17)\n\nThe \"third mutation\" in this list is p.P316S.\n\nThe Abstract states: \"None of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected.\" The \"other\" variants refer to those besides p.D620N.\nOn page 3, first full paragraph in the left column, it states: \"The remaining variants analyzed in this study were not identified in any patients.\" This means that the p.P316S mutation (the third one listed) was not detected in any patient, including BIII-8.\n\nSince the p.P316S mutation was not observed in patient BIII-8, an \"observed (mutant) allele\" for this specific mutation in this patient cannot be provided based on the document.\n\nInformation not found"
