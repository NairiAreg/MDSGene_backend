  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the third gene with a pathogenic variant found in the patient (if any)?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document states on page 3, in the paragraph under \"Results\" and \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\": \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" Patient AII-11 is one such patient with the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene (Table 1 and Figure 1A).\n\nThe document mentions on page 2, under \"Subjects\": \"Some of the selected subjects had been confirmed negative for SNCA, PARK2, PINK1, PARK7, LRRK2, and PLA2G6 mutations.\" However, it does not specify if patient AII-11 was among these subjects, nor does it state that any pathogenic variants were found in these genes for patient AII-11. Being \"confirmed negative\" means no pathogenic variant was found.\n\nThe document only explicitly identifies one gene (VPS35) with a pathogenic variant for patient AII-11. There is no information provided in the document about a second, let alone a third, gene with a pathogenic variant found in patient AII-11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nInformation not found."
