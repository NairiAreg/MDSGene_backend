  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document states the following about patient CII-3 from Family C:\n1.  Patient CII-3 is listed in Table 1, \"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers.\"\n2.  For patient CII-3, under the \"VPS35 p.D620N\" row, the genotype is listed as \"A/G\". This indicates that patient CII-3 is heterozygous for the p.D620N mutation.\n3.  The \"Results\" section (page 3) states: \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD...\" Patient CII-3 is one of these patients.\n4.  Crucially, the same section states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" And further: \"The remaining variants analyzed in this study [the other 6 of the 7 reported nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35] were not identified in any patients.\"\n\nThis means that for patient CII-3, only one mutation (p.D620N) was identified among the variants screened in the VPS35 gene. The document does not provide information about a \"first,\" \"second,\" or \"third\" distinct mutation *within patient CII-3*. It identifies one specific mutation (p.D620N) and its zygosity (heterozygous) for this patient.\n\nTherefore, information regarding the zygosity of a \"third mutation\" for patient CII-3 is not found, as the document only describes one mutation (p.D620N) being present in this patient from the variants screened.\n\nInformation not found.",
