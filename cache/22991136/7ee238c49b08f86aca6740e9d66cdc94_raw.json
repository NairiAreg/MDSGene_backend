  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What functional evidence supports the pathogenicity of the first mutation?",
  "context": "The document states that for patient CII-3, the p.D620N mutation was detected (Table 1, Table 2, Fig 1C).\n\nOn page 4, in the Discussion section, the text says: \"VPS35 assembles into the retromer cargo-recognition complex that associates with the cytosolic face of the endosomes. The retromer mediates the retrograde transport of transmembrane cargo from the endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. The p.D620N mutation of VPS35 might cause impairment of interaction with other components of the retromer complex and impaired retrograde trafficking of recycling proteins, similar to a-synuclein and LRRK2, which are involved in vesicle trafficking. Mutations in familial PD genes, including VPS35, may cause disruption of intracellular trafficking and lead to neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that impairment of intracellular trafficking systems is associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Although the association between the p.D620N mutation of VPS35 and PD remains unknown, further functional studies might shed light on the pathogenesis of VPS35 mutation and the effects of interaction with other known pathogenic gene products on PD.\"\n\nThis section describes the *potential* or *hypothesized* functional impact of the p.D620N mutation based on the known function of VPS35 and the retromer complex, and by analogy to other PD genes. It suggests what the mutation *might* do (\"might cause impairment\"). However, it does not provide specific experimental functional evidence from *this study* (e.g., cell-based assays, protein studies demonstrating altered function) that directly supports the pathogenicity of the p.D620N mutation. It also states that \"the association between the p.D620N mutation of VPS35 and PD remains unknown\" in terms of detailed mechanism and that \"further functional studies might shed light on the pathogenesis\".\n\nTherefore, based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, specific functional evidence supporting the pathogenicity of the p.D620N mutation (the first and only mutation mentioned for CII-3 in this paper) is discussed in terms of potential mechanisms but not presented as direct experimental findings from this study.\n\nInformation not found."
