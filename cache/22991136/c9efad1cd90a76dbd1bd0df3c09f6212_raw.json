  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nPatient 'BIII-8' from 'Family B' is discussed in the document. Table 1 (\"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\") on page 3 shows that patient 'BIII-8' has the genotype 'A/G' for the \"VPS35 p.D620N\" mutation. The text on page 2 states, \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation...\". The mutation is specified as c.1858G>A (p.D620N) on page 2. This means that at the DNA level (c.1858), patient BIII-8 has one 'A' allele (the mutant allele resulting in p.D620N) and one 'G' allele (the wild-type allele, which would result in p.D620).\n\nThe question asks for the \"standardized alias for the second mutation\".\nThe p.D620N is the identified mutation. The 'G' allele represents the wild-type state at this position, not a second mutation.\nFurthermore, the document states on page 3: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" This indicates that no other mutations in the VPS35 gene were found in these patients, including BIII-8.\n\nTherefore, the document does not provide information about a \"second mutation\" for patient 'BIII-8'.\n\nInformation not found",
