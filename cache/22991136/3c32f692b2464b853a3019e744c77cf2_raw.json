  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the physical genomic location of the mutation?",
  "context": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nThe mutation in patient 'AII-11' from 'Family A' is the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene.\n\nTable 1, \"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers,\" lists several microsatellite markers on Chromosome 16. Specifically, it lists markers \"Chr16_45.333M\", \"Chr16_45.615M\", \"Chr16_45.806M\", \"Chr16_45.835M\", and \"Chr16_45.855M\". The VPS35 gene (containing the p.D620N mutation) is shown in this table as being located among these Chromosome 16 markers.\n\nFurthermore, the text on page 4, right column, first paragraph, states: \"By genotyping of D16S3105, which is located approximately 1.5 kb centromeric of VPS35...\" D16S3105 is also listed in Table 1.\n\nTherefore, the physical genomic location of the mutation is within the VPS35 gene, which is located on Chromosome 16, near the markers Chr16_45.333M and D16S3105."
