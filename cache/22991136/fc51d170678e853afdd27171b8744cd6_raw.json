  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': Zygosity of second mutation?",
  "context": "The document provides information about patient 'BIII-8' from 'Family B'.\n1.  Figure 1B on page 3 shows the pedigree for Family B, and patient BIII-8 is indicated.\n2.  Table 1 on page 3, \"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\", lists patient BIII-8. For the \"VPS35 p.D620N\" locus, patient BIII-8 is shown as \"A/G\". This indicates that patient BIII-8 is heterozygous for the p.D620N mutation (c.1858G>A, where 'G' is the wild-type allele and 'A' is the mutant allele).\n3.  The \"Results\" section, under \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\" on page 2, states: \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD...\" Patient BIII-8 is one of these ADPD patients.\n4.  Crucially, regarding any *other* mutations in the VPS35 gene for these patients, the first paragraph of the \"Results\" section on page 3 states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\n\nThis last statement means that for patients who had the p.D620N mutation (including BIII-8), no other mutations (\"variants\") were found in the coding regions (exons) of the VPS35 gene. Therefore, according to this document, there is no \"second mutation\" in the VPS35 gene for patient BIII-8.\n\nSince no second mutation in VPS35 for patient BIII-8 is reported in the document, the zygosity of such a second mutation cannot be determined from the provided information. The document does not mention any other mutations in other genes for patient BIII-8 specifically.\n\nTherefore, based only on the information contained within the provided document, the zygosity of a second mutation for patient BIII-8 is not found.\n\nInformation not found"
