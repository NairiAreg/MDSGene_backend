  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': How many affected individuals in the family have homozygous mutations?",
  "context": "Based on the information in the document:\n\n*   On page 2, under \"Results\" and \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation,\" the text states: \"We detected the **heterozygous** missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD...\" Family B is one of these ADPD families (as shown in Figure 1B on page 3).\n*   On page 3, Table 1 (\"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\") shows that patient BIII-8 has the \"VPS35 p.D620N\" mutation as \"A/G\", which indicates a heterozygous state.\n*   On page 4, in the \"Discussion\" section, the first paragraph states: \"We detected the **heterozygous** p.D620N mutation of VPS35 in 3 ADPD families...\"\n\nThe document consistently describes the detected p.D620N mutation in the ADPD families, which includes Family B and patient BIII-8, as heterozygous. There is no information in the document indicating that any affected individual in Family B (or any other family studied) had homozygous mutations.\n\nTherefore, regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B', the number of affected individuals in the family (Family B) who have homozygous mutations is 0."
