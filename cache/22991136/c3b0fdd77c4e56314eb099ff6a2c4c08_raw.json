  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the first gene with a pathogenic variant found in the patient?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe first gene with a pathogenic variant found in patient 'AII-11' from 'Family A' is **VPS35**.\n\nEvidence:\n*   Page 3, Figure 1 shows \"Family A\" and patient \"AII-11\". The figure caption states: \"Pedigrees of families with the VPS35 p.D620N mutation\".\n*   Page 3, Table 1 (\"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\") lists patient \"AII-11\" and shows \"VPS35 p.D620N\" with allele \"A\".\n*   Page 3, first paragraph of the right column: \"The p.D620N has been reported previously as a pathogenic mutation for familial PD.\"\n*   Page 3, same paragraph: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" This implies the p.D620N in VPS35 is the variant found in these patients, including AII-11.\n*   Page 4, Discussion, first paragraph: \"We detected the heterozygous p.D620N mutation of VPS35 in 3 ADPD families...\" Patient AII-11 is part of Family A, an ADPD family."
