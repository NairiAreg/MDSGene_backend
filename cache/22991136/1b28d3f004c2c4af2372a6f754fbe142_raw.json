  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the pathogenicity classification for the first mutation?",
  "context": "The document states the following about the p.D620N mutation:\n\n1.  In the ABSTRACT: \"We screened 7 reported nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35, including p.D620N, known as **potentially disease-associated variants** of PD...\"\n2.  On page 2, in the Introduction section: \"One missense mutation has been reported to be **pathogenic** for PD. Mutation of c.1858G>A (p.D620N) was identified in 3 Austrian families...\"\n3.  On page 3, in the Results section under \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\": \"The p.D620N has been reported previously as a **pathogenic mutation** for familial PD.\"\n\nPatient CII-3 was found to have the p.D620N mutation. The document consistently refers to prior reports classifying p.D620N as \"pathogenic\". While the abstract uses \"potentially disease-associated\" when listing the variants screened, the more specific descriptions of p.D620N itself within the text refer to its established pathogenicity in prior literature.\n\nBased *only* on the information in the document, the most direct and consistently reported classification for the p.D620N mutation (which is the first and only mutation mentioned for patient CII-3) is pathogenic.\n\nPathogenic"
