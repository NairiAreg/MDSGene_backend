  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nPatient 'BIII-8' from 'Family B' is discussed in the document, particularly in Figure 1B and Table 1 on page 3.\nTable 1 indicates that patient BIII-8 has the 'VPS35 p.D620N' mutation, with a genotype of 'A/G', signifying heterozygosity for this mutation.\n\nThe document states in the \"Results\" section under \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\" (page 3): \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" This means that for patient BIII-8, who carries the p.D620N mutation, no other variants (and therefore no \"second mutation\") in the VPS35 gene were identified in this study.\n\nFurthermore, the document was published in 2012. The gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database) v2.1.1 was released significantly later. Therefore, the document does not contain any frequency data from gnomAD v2.1.1.\n\nSince the document does not identify a \"second mutation\" for patient BIII-8 in the VPS35 gene, and it does not contain any gnomAD v2.1.1 frequency data, the requested information cannot be found.\n\nInformation not found.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What is the gnomAD v2.1.1 frequency for the second mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What is the gnomAD v2.1.1 frequency for the second mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
