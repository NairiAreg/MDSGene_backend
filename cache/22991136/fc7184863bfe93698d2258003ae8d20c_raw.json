  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'D': What is the first gene with a pathogenic variant found in the patient?",
  "context": "Based only on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document states on page 2, under \"Results\" and \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\": \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD and 1 patient with SPD (Fig. 1).\"\n\nOn page 3, Table 2 lists \"Patient D\" as one of the patients with the p.D620N mutation.\n\nThe title of the article is \"VPS35 Mutation in Japanese Patients with Typical Parkinson's Disease\". The abstract and multiple sections throughout the paper (e.g., page 2, \"Genetic Analysis\"; page 3, Figure 1 caption) confirm that the p.D620N mutation is a variant of the VPS35 gene.\n\nThe document does not mention any other pathogenic variants found in patient 'D' in any other gene prior to or alongside this finding. Therefore, the first gene with a pathogenic variant found in patient 'D' according to this document is VPS35.\n\nAnswer: VPS35"
