  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nOn page 2, under \"Results\" and the sub-heading \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\", the text states: \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD and 1 patient with SPD (Fig. 1).\"\n\nOn page 4, in the first paragraph of the \"Discussion\" section, it states: \"We detected the heterozygous p.D620N mutation of VPS35 in 3 ADPD families and 1 SPD patient with East Asian ancestry.\" It also states in the same paragraph: \"Because the family history of patient D was unknown, she was categorized as SPD.\"\n\nTable 1 on page 3, under \"Patient ID\" D, for the row \"VPS35 p.D620N\", shows \"A/G\", which indicates heterozygosity.\n\nThe p.D620N mutation is the only mutation discussed in relation to patient D.\n\nTherefore, the zygosity of the first (and only specified) mutation for patient 'D' is heterozygous.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'D': What is the zygosity of the first mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'D': What is the zygosity of the first mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
