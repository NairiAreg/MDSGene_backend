  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': Zygosity of third mutation?",
  "context": "Based on the information contained within the provided document:\n\n*   Page 3, first column, first paragraph states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\n*   Patient AII-11 is identified as carrying the p.D620N mutation (Table 1, Table 2).\n*   The document focuses on the p.D620N mutation and screening for 6 other specific variants, none of which were found.\n\nTherefore, the document indicates that patient AII-11 only has the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene, and no other variants (including a \"third mutation\") were detected in this gene for this patient.\n\nThus, the zygosity of a third mutation cannot be provided as the document does not state that a third mutation was found in patient AII-11.\n\nAnswer: Information not found"
