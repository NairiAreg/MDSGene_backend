  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\n1.  The question asks about patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A' and how many *affected individuals in that family* have *heterozygous mutations*.\n\n2.  Figure 1 on page 3 shows the pedigree for \"Family A\". Patient AII-11 is the proband (indicated by an arrow) and is an affected member (closed symbol). The asterisk on AII-11 indicates this individual was \"analyzed for the p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype\".\n\n3.  On page 2, under \"Results\", in the section \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\", the text states: \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD and 1 patient with SPD (Fig. 1).\" Patient AII-11 is the proband of Family A, which is one of the ADPD families shown in Figure 1. Therefore, patient AII-11 is one of these 3 ADPD patients and has the heterozygous p.D620N mutation. This accounts for one affected individual in Family A with a heterozygous mutation.\n\n4.  The question asks for the total number of *affected individuals in Family A* who have heterozygous mutations. We need to see if information is provided for other affected members of Family A.\n    *   Figure 1A shows other affected individuals in Family A (e.g., I-1, AII-2, AII-4, AII-6, AII-12).\n    *   Patient AII-12 (an affected sibling of AII-11) is also marked with an asterisk, meaning AII-12 was \"analyzed for the p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype\".\n    *   However, the document does not explicitly state the results of the p.D620N mutation analysis for AII-12 or any other affected members of Family A, besides AII-11 (who is one of the 3 index ADPD patients found with the heterozygous mutation).\n    *   Table 1 (\"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\") only lists AII-11 from Family A, further indicating that detailed mutation carrier information from Family A is primarily focused on this proband.\n\n5.  The document confirms that patient AII-11 is an affected individual in Family A with a heterozygous p.D620N mutation. It does not provide explicit confirmation that any *other* affected individuals in Family A also have this heterozygous mutation.\n\nTherefore, based only on the information provided in the document, there is 1 affected individual in Family A (AII-11) confirmed to have a heterozygous mutation.\n\nAnswer: 1",
