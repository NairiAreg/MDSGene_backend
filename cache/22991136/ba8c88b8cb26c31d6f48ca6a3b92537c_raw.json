  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What functional evidence supports the pathogenicity of the first mutation?",
  "context": "Based only on the information contained within the provided document, the following functional evidence supports the pathogenicity of the p.D620N mutation (the first and only mutation mentioned for patient AII-11 in the VPS35 gene):\n\nThe document states that VPS35 is a key component of the retromer cargo-recognition complex, which is involved in sorting cargos for retrieval to the trans-Golgi network. It explains that \"pathogenic mutations of VPS35 may cause disruption of the retrograde transport system and contribute to dopaminergic neuronal cell death in PD\" (Page 2).\n\nMore specifically regarding the p.D620N mutation, the document discusses (Page 4):\n\"The p.D620N mutation of VPS35 might cause impairment of interaction with other components of the retromer complex and impaired retrograde trafficking of recycling proteins... Mutations in familial PD genes, including VPS35, may cause disruption of intracellular trafficking and lead to neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that impairment of intracellular trafficking systems is associated with the pathogenesis of PD.\"\n\nTherefore, the functional evidence supporting its pathogenicity, as described in this document, is its potential to disrupt the retrograde transport system by impairing the retromer complex's function, specifically by potentially causing impairment of interaction with other retromer components and impaired retrograde trafficking, which can lead to neurodegeneration."
