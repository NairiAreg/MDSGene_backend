  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the document:\n\n*   Patient BIII-8 from Family B was analyzed for the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene (Figure 1, Table 1).\n*   Table 1 shows that for \"VPS35 p.D620N\", patient BIII-8 has the genotype \"A/G\".\n*   The text on page 2 under \"Genetic Analysis\" clarifies that the p.D620N mutation corresponds to c.1858G>A. This means 'G' is the wild-type allele and 'A' is the mutant allele for this specific mutation.\n*   The text on page 3, under \"Results\", states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\n\nThe question asks for the observed (mutant) allele for the *second* mutation. The document indicates that only one mutation (p.D620N) was found in VPS35 for patient BIII-8, and no other variants in VPS35 were detected in these patients.\n\nTherefore, the information about a second mutation for patient BIII-8 is not found in the document.\n\nInformation not found",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What is the observed (mutant) allele for the second mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What is the observed (mutant) allele for the second mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
