  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nOn page 2, under \"Genetic Analysis\", the document states: \"SPD patients and control subjects were also genotyped for **c.1858G>A (p.D620N)** mutation...\"\n\nFigure 1 on page 3 shows patient BIII-8 (from family B) as having the p.D620N mutation. Table 1 on page 3 also lists patient BIII-8 under \"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers.\"\n\nTherefore, the genomic-level notation for the mutation in patient BIII-8 is **c.1858G>A**.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What is the genomic-level notation for the first mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What is the genomic-level notation for the first mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
