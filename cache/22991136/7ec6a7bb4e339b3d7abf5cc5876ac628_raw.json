  "raw_answer": "Based on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document states that \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" (Page 3, paragraph under FIG. 1). Patient CII-3 from Family C is one of the patients identified with the p.D620N mutation. Therefore, the document does not identify a \"third mutation\" for patient CII-3.\n\nInformation not found.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the physical genomic location of the third mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the physical genomic location of the third mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
