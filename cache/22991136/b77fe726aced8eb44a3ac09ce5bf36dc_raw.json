The figure caption states \"Pedigrees of families with the VPS35 p.D620N mutation\". Table 2 on page 3 lists clinical features for patient CII-3, under the heading \"Clinical features of patients with p.D620N mutation\". The abstract and multiple sections throughout the paper confirm that the p.D620N mutation is in the VPS35 gene and is considered pathogenic.)"
