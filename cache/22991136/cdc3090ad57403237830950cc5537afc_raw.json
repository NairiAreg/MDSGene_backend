  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the protein-level effect of the mutation?",
  "context": "Based on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nFor patient 'AII-11' from 'Family A', the mutation is identified as the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene (Figure 1, Table 1, page 3).\n\nThe protein-level effect of this mutation is a **missense mutation**, specifically the **p.D620N substitution**. This means that at amino acid position 620 of the VPS35 protein, an Aspartic acid (D) is replaced by an Asparagine (N).\n\nThis is stated in the abstract: \"The p.D620N mutation was detected...\" and \"...p.D620N substitution may be a mutational hot spot...\".\nAnd in the Results section (page 2): \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation...\".\nFigure 1 (page 3) shows Family A having the \"VPS35 p.D620N mutation\".\nTable 1 (page 3) lists patient AII-11 under \"VPS35 p.D620N\" as \"A\", indicating the presence of the G>A nucleotide change that results in the D620N amino acid change."
