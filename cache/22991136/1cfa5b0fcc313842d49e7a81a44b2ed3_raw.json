  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nThe ABSTRACT states: \"The p.D620N mutation was detected in 3 patients with autosomal dominant PD (1.0%).\"\nFigure 1 shows \"Family A\" with patient \"AII-11\" as an affected individual analyzed for the mutation. The caption for Figure 1 is \"Pedigrees of families with the VPS35 p.D620N mutation\".\nTable 1, \"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers,\" lists patient \"AII-11\" and has a row for \"VPS35 p.D620N\".\nTable 2, \"Clinical features of patients with p.D620N mutation,\" lists patient \"AII-11\".\nOn page 3, under Results, \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\", it states: \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD...\" and \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" This implies that p.D620N is the primary and, in this study for VPS35, the only mutation identified for these patients.\n\nThe standardized alias for the first (and in this context, the only VPS35 mutation discussed for this patient) is p.D620N.\n\np.D620N",
