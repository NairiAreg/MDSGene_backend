  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the provided document, the study design involves screening for genetic mutations in different groups of individuals.\n\nThe abstract states: \"We screened 7 reported nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35... in 300 Japanese index patients with autosomal dominant PD and 433 patients with sporadic PD (SPD) by direct sequencing or high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. In addition, we screened 579 controls for the p.D620N mutation by HRM analysis.\"\n\nThe \"Patients and Methods\" section (page 2) further details: \"The study subjects were 308 Japanese patients (300 index patients) with ADPD... and 433 Japanese SPD patients... selected from the gene bank of Juntendo University... From the same gene bank, we also selected 579 healthy Japanese subjects without a family history of parkinsonism (age at sampling...)... Patients with ADPD and SPD were examined for the following 7 variants... SPD patients and control subjects were also genotyped for c.1858G>A (p.D620N) mutation...\"\n\nThis methodology, where groups of individuals with a disease (cases, here PD patients like Patient D who is an SPD patient) are compared with a group of individuals without the disease (controls) to assess the frequency of an exposure (here, VPS35 mutations), is characteristic of a **case-control study**. The primary method used to assess the \"exposure\" is genetic screening.\n\nWhile the article does not explicitly state \"the study design is a case-control study,\" the description of the methodology (selection of cases and controls, and comparison of mutation frequency between them) clearly defines it as such.\n\nTherefore, the study design is a case-control study.",
