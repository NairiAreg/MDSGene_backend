  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nPatient CII-3 from Family C was found to have the p.D620N mutation in the **VPS35** gene (Page 3, FIG. 1.C and Table 1). The text also states, \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35\" (Page 3).\n\nThe document mentions that \"Some of the selected subjects had been confirmed negative for SNCA, PARK2, PINK1, PARK7, LRRK2, and PLA2G6 mutations\" (Page 2). However, it does not explicitly state that patient CII-3 was tested for these genes, nor does it mention any *other* pathogenic gene variants found in patient CII-3 beyond the one in VPS35.\n\nTherefore, the document only identifies one gene (VPS35) with a pathogenic variant in patient CII-3. Information about a second or third gene with a pathogenic variant for this specific patient is not provided.\n\nInformation not found.",
