  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in Figure 1 (Pedigrees of families with the VPS35 p.D620N mutation) on page 3:\n\n1.  **Identify Family B:** Pedigree B is shown in Figure 1.\n2.  **Identify patient BIII-8:** Patient BIII-8 is an affected female (closed circle) in generation III. She has an asterisk, indicating she was \"analyzed for the p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype.\" Table 1 confirms BIII-8 has the A/G genotype for VPS35 p.D620N, meaning she has the mutation.\n3.  **Identify unaffected individuals in Family B:**\n    *   Generation I: I-1 (male)\n    *   Generation II: II-1 (male), II-4 (female)\n    *   Generation III: III-1 (male), III-2 (male), III-3 (female), III-4 (female), III-5 (male), III-6 (male), III-7 (female)\n4.  **Determine if these unaffected individuals were analyzed for mutations (and thus if their wildtype status is known):**\n    The legend for Figure 1 states: \"asterisk, individual analyzed for the p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype\".\n    Looking at Pedigree B, none of the unaffected individuals (I-1, II-1, II-4, III-1, III-2, III-3, III-4, III-5, III-6, III-7) have an asterisk.\n\nTherefore, the document does not state whether these unaffected individuals were tested for the mutation, and thus it does not state how many of them have wildtype (no mutations).\n\nInformation not found",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': How many unaffected individuals in the family have wildtype (no mutations)?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': How many unaffected individuals in the family have wildtype (no mutations)?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
