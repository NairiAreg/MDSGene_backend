  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document states on page 2, left column: \"Mutation of c.1858G>A (p.D620N) was identified...\".\nOn page 3, Figure 1 shows patient CII-3 (from family C) as an affected individual analyzed for the p.D620N mutation. Table 1 and Table 2 also list patient CII-3 as having the p.D620N mutation.\n\nTherefore, the DNA-level mutation for patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C' is **c.1858G>A**.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the DNA-level mutation? (Primary mutation)",
