  "raw_answer": "The document provides the following information regarding patient 'D':\n\n1.  Patient 'D' is one of the subjects who has the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene (Page 3, Fig. 1 and surrounding text; Page 4, \"patient D\").\n2.  The paper discusses haplotype analysis which suggests multiple founder events for the p.D620N mutation. On page 4, it states: \"By genotyping of D16S3105... there were at least 3 different haplotypes in Japanese because families A and C and patient D (SPD) did not have the same alleles for this microsatellite.\" This indicates that patient 'D' represents one of these distinct haplotypes/founder events for the p.D620N mutation, which could be considered the \"third\" distinct genetic origin mentioned.\n3.  Regarding the zygosity of this p.D620N mutation in patient 'D':\n    *   Page 2, under \"Results\", \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\": \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD and 1 patient with SPD (Fig. 1).\" Patient 'D' is the patient with SPD.\n    *   Page 3, Table 1 (\"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\"): For \"Patient ID\" D, under the row \"VPS35 p.D620N\", the genotype is listed as \"A/G\", which indicates heterozygosity.\n    *   Page 4, \"Discussion\": \"We detected the heterozygous p.D620N mutation of VPS35 in 3 ADPD families and 1 SPD patient with East Asian ancestry.\" Patient 'D' is the SPD patient.\n\nThe \"third mutation\" in the question likely refers to the p.D620N mutation as found in patient 'D', who represents one of the at least three distinct founder events for this mutation in the studied population. The zygosity of this mutation in patient 'D' is heterozygous.\n\nThe document also states on page 3: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" This confirms that for the VPS35 gene, p.D620N is the only mutation found in patient 'D'.\n\nTherefore, the zygosity of the p.D620N mutation (which is the relevant mutation for Patient 'D' and can be contextualized as the \"third\" in terms of founder events) is heterozygous.\n\nHeterozygous",
