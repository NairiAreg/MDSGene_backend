  "raw_answer": "The document provides the following information regarding patient 'AII-11' from 'Family A':\n\n1.  Patient AII-11 is the proband from Family A (Figure 1A, page 3).\n2.  Family A is one of the families with Autosomal Dominant Parkinson's Disease (ADPD) where the p.D620N mutation in VPS35 was detected (Abstract; page 2, Results: \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD...\").\n3.  Specifically regarding patient AII-11, the text states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" (Page 3, left column, paragraph 2).\n    This means that for patient AII-11, who carries the p.D620N mutation, no *other* (i.e., no second) mutation was found in the VPS35 gene when all exons were analyzed.\n\nSince the document states that no other variants (second mutations) were found in the VPS35 gene for patients with the p.D620N mutation (which includes AII-11), there is no \"second mutation\" identified in the VPS35 gene for this patient within this document. Therefore, the zygosity of a non-identified second mutation cannot be provided based on the information in the document.\n\nInformation not found.",
