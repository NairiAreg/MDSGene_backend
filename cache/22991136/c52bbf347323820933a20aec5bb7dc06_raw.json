  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the genomic-level notation for the second mutation?",
  "context": "On page 3, under the section \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\", the text states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\n\nPatient AII-11 is identified as carrying the p.D620N mutation (Fig. 1A, Table 1, and the text on page 3: \"One disease allele was detected by analyzing patient AII-11...\").\n\nSince the document states that patients with the p.D620N mutation (which includes AII-11) did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35, there is no information about a second mutation for this patient.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nInformation not found"
