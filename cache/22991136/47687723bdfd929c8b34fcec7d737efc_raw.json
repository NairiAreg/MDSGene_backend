  "raw_answer": "The document states in the \"Genetic Analysis\" section on page 2:\n\"Patients with ADPD and SPD were examined for the following 7 variants: p.M571 (exon 3), p.1241M (exon 7), p.P316S (exon 9), p.R524W (exon 13), p.D620N (exon 15), p.A737V (exon 16), and p.L774M (exon 17) of VPS35 (RefSeq accession number NM_018206.4).\"\n\nPatient AII-11 is an ADPD patient from Family A who was found to have the p.D620N mutation in VPS35. Therefore, the analysis for this patient would have used this specified RefSeq transcript. The document does not explicitly name a genome build (e.g., hg19, GRCh37).\n\nBased *only* on the information provided:\nThe transcript used was RefSeq accession number NM_018206.4 for the VPS35 gene. Information about a specific genome build name is not provided.\n\nThus, the answer is:\nRefSeq accession number NM_018206.4 (for VPS35).",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': Which genome build/transcript was used?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': Which genome build/transcript was used?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
