  "raw_answer": "The protein-level effect of the mutation in patient 'BIII-8' from 'Family B' is **p.D620N**.\n\nThis can be inferred from:\n1.  **Figure 1 (page 3):** Patient BIII-8 is shown in Pedigree B. The caption for Figure 1 states: \"Pedigrees of families with the VPS35 p.D620N mutation\".\n2.  **Table 1 (page 3):** \"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\" lists patient BIII-8. The row for \"VPS35 p.D620N\" shows \"A/G\" for BIII-8, indicating heterozygosity for the mutation.\n3.  **Results section (page 2):** \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\": \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD...\" and refers to Figure 1.\n4.  **Abstract (page 1):** \"The p.D620N mutation was detected in 3 patients with autosomal dominant PD...\" and later \"In VPS35, p.D620N substitution may be a mutational hot spot...\".\n\nThe notation \"p.D620N\" signifies a protein-level change where Aspartic acid (D) at position 620 is substituted with Asparagine (N). The document also refers to this as a \"missense p.D620N mutation\".",
