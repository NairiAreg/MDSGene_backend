  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the document:\nPage 3, under the \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\" section, states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" Patient D is one of the patients identified with the p.D620N mutation. This means that for the VPS35 gene, no second mutation was found in Patient D.\n\nThe question asks for a \"Second mutation (cDNA), if any?\" without specifying the gene. While the document confirms no *other* mutations were found *in VPS35* for patient D, it does not provide information about whether patient D was screened for or found to have mutations in *other* genes that could be considered a \"second mutation\" in the context of their overall genetic profile for PD. The study's focus for patient D, once identified, is on the VPS35 p.D620N mutation.\n\nTherefore, specific information about a \"second mutation\" (potentially in a gene other than VPS35) for patient D is not provided in the document.\n\nInformation not found",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'D': Second mutation (cDNA), if any?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'D': Second mutation (cDNA), if any?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
