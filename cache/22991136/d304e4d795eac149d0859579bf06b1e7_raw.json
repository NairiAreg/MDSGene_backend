  "raw_answer": "The document provides the following information regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A' and the mutation:\n\n1.  **Identification of the Mutation:** The abstract states: \"The p.D620N mutation was detected in 3 patients with autosomal dominant PD... None of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected.\" Page 3, Figure 1A shows the pedigree for Family A, and patient II-11 (AII-11) is marked as affected and analyzed. The text on page 3 mentions \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35,\" indicating p.D620N is the relevant mutation.\n\n2.  **Genotype of the Mutation:** The \"Results\" section on page 2 states: \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD...\" Patient AII-11 is one of these patients with ADPD from Family A.\n\n3.  **Nucleotide Change:** The \"Genetic Analysis\" section on page 2 refers to the mutation as \"c.1858G>A (p.D620N)\". The \"Discussion\" on page 4 also refers to \"the substitution of VPS35 c.1858G>A (p.D620N)\".\n\nBased on this information, the \"first mutation\" (which is the only VPS35 mutation detected in this patient according to the text) is p.D620N (c.1858G>A), and the genotype of patient AII-11 for this mutation is heterozygous.\n\nTherefore, the genotype of the first mutation for patient 'AII-11' is heterozygous p.D620N (or heterozygous c.1858G>A). The document most directly states it as \"heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation\".\n\nHeterozygous p.D620N",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the genotype of the first mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the genotype of the first mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
