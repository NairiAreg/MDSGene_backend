  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the genomic-level notation for the third mutation?",
  "context": "Information not found.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe document identifies patient CII-3 from Family C as having the VPS35 p.D620N mutation (Figure 1, Table 1, Table 2). The genomic-level notation for this specific mutation is provided as c.1858G>A (page 2, \"Genetic Analysis\" and page 4, \"Discussion\").\n\nHowever, the question asks for the \"third mutation\" for this patient. The document states in the Abstract: \"The p.D620N mutation was detected in 3 patients with autosomal dominant PD... None of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected.\" On page 3, it reiterates: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\n\nThis indicates that only one mutation (p.D620N / c.1858G>A) was identified in patient CII-3 out of the variants screened. The document does not provide information about patient CII-3 having two other mutations, and thus no information about a \"third mutation\" for this specific patient."
