  "raw_answer": "Based on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe abstract states: \"Patients with the VPS35 mutation showed typical tremor-predominant PD.\"\nThe \"Discussion\" section (page 4) states: \"The clinical symptoms of our patients with VPS35 mutation closely resembled the idiopathic PD form, with tremor-dominant dopa-responsive parkinsonism.\"\n\nPatient CII-3 is one of the patients with the p.D620N VPS35 mutation (as shown in Table 2 and implied by Figure 1C and Table 1).\n\nTherefore, according to the document, patient CII-3 would exhibit typical parkinsonian features, not atypical ones.\n\nThe document does not state that patient CII-3 has atypical parkinsonian features. Instead, it characterizes the features of patients with this mutation (including CII-3) as \"typical.\"\n\nThus, the answer is: No, the document indicates that patients with the VPS35 mutation, such as CII-3, showed typical tremor-predominant PD and symptoms that closely resembled the idiopathic PD form. It does not state that patient CII-3 has atypical parkinsonian features.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': Does the patient have atypical parkinsonian features?",
