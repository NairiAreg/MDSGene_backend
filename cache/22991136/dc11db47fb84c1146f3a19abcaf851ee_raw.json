  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nPatient BIII-8 is from Family B (Fig. 1B, page 3). Figure 1B shows the pedigree for Family B.\n- Patient BIII-8 is an affected individual (closed square).\n- The legend for Figure 1 states: \"asterisk, individual analyzed for the p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype\". Patient BIII-8 has an asterisk.\n- Table 1 on page 3 shows that patient BIII-8 has the \"VPS35 p.D620N\" mutation with alleles \"A/G\", indicating a heterozygous mutation.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *unaffected* individuals in Family B who have heterozygous mutations.\n- In Figure 1B, unaffected individuals are represented by open symbols (circles or squares).\n- In Family B (Fig. 1B), none of the unaffected individuals (open symbols) have an asterisk. This means that, according to the figure, no unaffected individuals in Family B were analyzed for the p.D620N mutation or haplotype.\n\nTherefore, the document does not provide information on whether any unaffected individuals in Family B have heterozygous mutations.\n\nInformation not found.",
