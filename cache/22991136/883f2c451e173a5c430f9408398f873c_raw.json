  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the gnomAD v4.0.0 frequency for the first mutation?",
  "context": "The mutation identified in patient 'CII-3' from 'Family C' is the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene (as seen in Table 1: Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers, and Table 2: Clinical features of patients with p.D620N mutation).\n\nA search of the document for \"gnomAD\" or \"gnomAD v4.0.0\" yields no results. The document discusses the frequency of the p.D620N mutation within its own study population (Japanese patients and controls) and references frequencies from other studies/populations, but none are specified as being from gnomAD v4.0.0.\n\nTherefore, based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nInformation not found."
