  "raw_answer": "Based on Table 2 (\"Clinical features of patients with p.D620N mutation\"), for patient 'CII-3':\n*   Dementia: — (not present)\n*   Hallucination: — (not present)\n*   Other psychosis: — (not present)\n\nThe text describing patient CII-3 (page 3, \"Clinical Presentation\") mentions: \"Patients BIII-8 and CII-3 both developed upper limb rest tremor at ages 34 and 55, respectively.\" This describes motor symptoms, not cognitive function.\n\nThe document does not list any subdomains of cognitive function as being affected for patient CII-3. For the cognitive/psychiatric items listed in Table 2, they are marked as not present for CII-3.\n\nTherefore, no subdomains of cognitive function are reported as affected for patient 'CII-3'.",
