  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What genetic methods were used in this study?",
  "context": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nFor patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C', the following genetic methods were used:\n1.  **PCR direct sequencing**: The document states on page 2, under \"Genetic Analysis\", that \"Patients with ADPD [autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease] ... were examined for the following 7 variants: ... p.D620N ... PCR direct sequencing was performed...\". Patient CII-3 is an ADPD patient who was found to have the p.D620N mutation (Fig 1C, Table 1, Table 2).\n2.  **Analysis of all exons of VPS35**: The document states on page 2, under \"Genetic Analysis\", \"All exons of VPS35 were also analyzed in patients with the p.D620N mutation using the method described previously.\" The \"method described previously\" refers to PCR direct sequencing. Patient CII-3 had the p.D620N mutation, so all their VPS35 exons were analyzed by this method.\n3.  **Haplotype analysis**: The document states on page 3, under \"Results\", \"Haplotype analysis demonstrated that the Japanese patients with the p.D620N mutation had different genotypes... patients CII-3 and D had a different genotype of D16S3105... (Table 1, boldface).\" Table 1 on page 3 explicitly lists haplotype data for patient CII-3."
