  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What is the reference allele for the second mutation?",
  "context": "Information not found.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe document describes the detection of the p.D620N mutation in VPS35 in several patients, including patient BIII-8 from Family B.\nTable 1 shows that for the \"VPS35 p.D620N\" site, patient BIII-8 has the genotype \"A/G\".\nOn page 2, under \"Genetic Analysis\", the p.D620N mutation is specified as \"c.1858G>A\". This indicates that 'G' is the reference allele and 'A' is the mutant allele for this specific p.D620N mutation.\nPatient BIII-8 is heterozygous (A/G), meaning they have one mutant allele (A) and one reference allele (G) *for this p.D620N mutation*.\n\nThe document states on page 3, first full paragraph: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\nThis implies that only one mutation (p.D620N) was identified in the VPS35 gene for these patients. Therefore, the document does not provide information about a \"second mutation\" in the VPS35 gene for patient BIII-8, and consequently, no reference allele for such a second mutation can be identified from the provided text."
