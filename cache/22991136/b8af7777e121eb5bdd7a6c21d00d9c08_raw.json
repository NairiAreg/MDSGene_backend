  "raw_answer": "The document provides the following information regarding patient 'AII-11' from 'Family A':\n1.  Patient AII-11 is part of Family A and carries the p.D620N mutation in the VPS35 gene (Figure 1A, Table 1, Table 2, Page 3 text). This mutation corresponds to c.1858G>A (Page 2, \"Genetic Analysis\" mentions c.1858G>A (p.D620N)). This is the first mutation.\n2.  The text on page 3 states: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\n3.  Since patient AII-11 is a carrier of the p.D620N mutation, this statement applies to AII-11. It means that no other variants (mutations) were found in any of the exons of the VPS35 gene for this patient beyond the p.D620N mutation.\n\nBased on this, patient AII-11 has one identified mutation (p.D620N or c.1858G>A) in the exons of the VPS35 gene, and no other mutations were found in the exons of this gene for this patient. Therefore, there is no second, and consequently no third, mutation reported for patient AII-11 in the VPS35 gene exons within this document.\n\nThe question asks for the \"Third mutation (cDNA), if any?\". Since the document indicates that no other mutations beyond the first one (p.D620N) were found in the VPS35 exons for this patient, the specific information for a third mutation is not present because, according to the findings reported, it does not exist in the VPS35 gene exons.\n\nTherefore, the information for a \"Third mutation (cDNA)\" is not found in the document.\n\nInformation not found",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': Third mutation (cDNA), if any?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': Third mutation (cDNA), if any?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
