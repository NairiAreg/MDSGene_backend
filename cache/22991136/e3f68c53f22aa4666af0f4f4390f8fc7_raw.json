  "raw_answer": "The document states on page 2, under \"Genetic Analysis,\" that the p.D620N mutation corresponds to c.1858G>A. This means the Guanine (G) allele is changed to an Adenine (A) allele. Therefore, the reference allele is G.\n\nTable 1 on page 3 shows that patient CII-3 has the genotype A/G for \"VPS35 p.D620N\". This means one allele is A (the mutant allele) and the other is G (the reference allele).\n\nThe reference allele for the first mutation (p.D620N, which is c.1858G>A) for patient 'CII-3' is G.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the reference allele for the first mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the reference allele for the first mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
