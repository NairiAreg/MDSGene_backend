  "raw_answer": "The document describes screening for 7 reported nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35. These are listed on page 2 in the \"Genetic Analysis\" section:\n1.  p.M57I (exon 3)\n2.  p.I241M (exon 7)\n3.  **p.P316S (exon 9)**\n4.  p.R524W (exon 13)\n5.  p.D620N (exon 15)\n6.  p.A737V (exon 16)\n7.  p.L774M (exon 17)\n\nThe \"third mutation\" in this list is p.P316S.\n\nThe abstract states: \"The p.D620N mutation was detected in 3 patients with autosomal dominant PD (1.0%), in 1 patient with SPD (0.23%), and in no controls. None of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected.\"\n\nOn page 3, in the \"Results\" section under \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\", it states: \"We detected the heterozygous missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD and 1 patient with SPD (Fig. 1). ... Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35. ... The remaining variants analyzed in this study were not identified in any patients.\"\n\nPatient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C' is one of the patients who carry the p.D620N mutation (as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1).\n\nSince \"none of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected\" (Abstract) and \"The remaining variants analyzed in this study [i.e., the 6 variants other than p.D620N, including p.P316S] were not identified in any patients\" (Page 3), the third mutation on the list (p.P316S) was not found in patient CII-3.\n\nTherefore, there is no \"observed (mutant) allele\" for the third mutation (p.P316S) in patient CII-3 reported in this document, because this mutation was not detected in this patient.\n\nInformation not found.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the observed (mutant) allele for the third mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the observed (mutant) allele for the third mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
