  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nFor patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A', the following genetic methods were used in this study:\n\n1.  **PCR direct sequencing:** The \"Genetic Analysis\" section states: \"Patients with ADPD and SPD were examined for the following 7 variants... p.D620N... PCR direct sequencing was performed...\" Patient AII-11 is an ADPD patient (Fig. 1A) who was found to have the p.D620N mutation.\n2.  **Analysis of all exons of VPS35:** The \"Genetic Analysis\" section states: \"All exons of VPS35 were also analyzed in patients with the p.D620N mutation using the method described previously.\" Patient AII-11 was identified as having the p.D620N mutation.\n3.  **Haplotype analysis:** Figure 1 indicates that individual AII-11 was analyzed for haplotype. Table 1 is titled \"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\" and includes patient AII-11. The \"Genetic Analysis\" section also describes that \"Haplotype analysis of the VPS35 flanking region was performed...\"",
