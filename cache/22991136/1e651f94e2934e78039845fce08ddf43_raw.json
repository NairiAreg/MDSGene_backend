  "raw_answer": "Based on the information in the document:\n\nOn page 2, under \"Results\", \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\", the text states: \"We detected the **heterozygous** missense p.D620N mutation in 3 unrelated patients with ADPD and 1 patient with SPD (Fig. 1).\"\n\nFigure 1A shows Family A, and individual AII-11 is an affected member of this family who was analyzed.\n\nOn page 4, in the \"Discussion\" section, it reiterates: \"We detected the **heterozygous** p.D620N mutation of VPS35 in 3 ADPD families...\" Since patient AII-11 is from Family A (an ADPD family), this applies to AII-11.\n\nThe document focuses on the p.D620N mutation. The abstract states, \"The p.D620N mutation was detected in 3 patients with autosomal dominant PD... None of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected.\" This implies that the p.D620N mutation is the \"first\" and only VPS35 mutation identified in these patients within this study.\n\nTherefore, the zygosity of the first (p.D620N) mutation for patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A' is **heterozygous**.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the zygosity of the first mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the zygosity of the first mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
