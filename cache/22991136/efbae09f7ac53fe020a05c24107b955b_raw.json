  "raw_answer": "Patient developed progressive dysphagia requiring gastrostomy at age 75. Subsequently, cognitive dysfunction without hallucination emerged; dementia was noted in context of the 15-year disease duration. A SPECT scan showed no reduction in basal ganglia blood flow.",
  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': What is the key clinical information about this patient?",
  "context": "Based on the document (Table 2 and the \"Clinical Presentation\" section on page 3, and a mention on page 4):\n\nPatient AII-11 from Family A is a man who was 77 years old at the time of the report.\n*   **Age at disease onset:** 62 years.\n*   **Disease duration:** 15 years (at the time of the report/data collection for Table 2).\n*   **Initial symptom:** Developed right upper limb rest tremor at age 62.\n*   **Parkinsonian features (from Table 2):**\n    *   Resting tremor: +\n    *   Bradykinesia: +\n    *   Rigidity: +\n    *   Gait disturbance: +\n    *   Postural instability: +\n    *   Clinical response to levodopa: +\n    *   Wearing off: +\n    *   Asymmetry at onset: +\n    *   Orthostatic hypotension: +\n    *   Incontinence: +\n    *   Urinary urgency: +\n    *   Levodopa-induced dyskinesia: +\n    *   Sleep benefit: +\n    *   Dystonia at onset: +\n*   **Disease progression:**\n    *   At age 75, he underwent gastrostomy for progressive dysphagia.\n    *   He then developed cognitive dysfunction without hallucination.\n    *   The document also states, \"dementia may occur in patients with a long disease course, similar to patient AII-11, who had PD for 15 years.\" (Table 2 lists \"Dementia: -\" which might reflect an earlier assessment or a specific definition not met at that point, while the text indicates later cognitive dysfunction/dementia).\n*   **Investigations:**\n    *   Brain MRI: Within normal limits (WNL).\n    *   Cardiac MIBG scintigraphy (performed when AII-11 was 76 years old): H/M ratio (E/L), 2.38/2.68; washout ratio, 4.15%.\n    *   Single-photon emission computed tomography of cerebral blood flow: Showed no reduction in blood flow in the basal ganglia.\n*   **Other clinical notes from Table 2:**\n    *   Hyperreflexia: -\n    *   Hallucination: - (though later text notes cognitive dysfunction *without* hallucination developing after gastrostomy)\n    *   Other psychosis: -\n    *   Gaze palsy: -\n*   **Family History:** His father and 4 of 8 siblings were diagnosed with PD. His nephew and niece were also diagnosed with PD."
