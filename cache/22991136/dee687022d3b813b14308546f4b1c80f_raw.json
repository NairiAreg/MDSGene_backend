  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'BIII-8' from family 'Family B': What type of mutation is the third variant?",
  "context": "The document describes the screening of 7 reported variants of VPS35. This list is provided in the \"Genetic Analysis\" section on page 2:\n1.  p.M571 (exon 3)\n2.  p.I241M (exon 7)\n3.  p.P316S (exon 9)\n4.  p.R524W (exon 13)\n5.  p.D620N (exon 15)\n6.  p.A737V (exon 16)\n7.  p.L774M (exon 17)\n\nThe third variant in this list is p.P316S.\n\nThe abstract states: \"We screened 7 reported nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35, including p.D620N...\"\nThe \"Subjects\" section on page 2 states: \"...a special focus on 7 reported nonsynonymous variants that were found in patients with PD, including the p.D620N.\"\n\nPatient BIII-8 from Family B was part of the study population screened for these variants. According to page 3, \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" Since patient BIII-8 carries the p.D620N mutation (Table 1, page 3), they would not have the p.P316S variant. However, the question asks for the type of the third variant (which is p.P316S from the screening list) in the context of the screening performed on patients like BIII-8.\n\nBased on the abstract, these 7 variants are \"nonsynonymous missense variants\". Therefore, the third variant (p.P316S) is a nonsynonymous missense variant.\n\nNonsynonymous missense variant."
