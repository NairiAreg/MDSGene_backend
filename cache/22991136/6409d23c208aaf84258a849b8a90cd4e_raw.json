  "question": "Format answer for: Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': Does the patient have sleep disorders?",
  "context": "The provided document contains Table 2 on page 3, which lists \"Clinical features of patients with p.D620N mutation\". For patient 'AII-11', under the clinical features, there is a row:\n\"Sleep benefit - \"\n\n\"Sleep benefit\" refers to the temporary improvement of Parkinson's disease symptoms after sleep. A minus sign (-) indicates that patient AII-11 did not experience this phenomenon. However, this does not directly state whether the patient has or does not have \"sleep disorders\" (such as insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder, restless leg syndrome, etc.). The table does not have a specific entry for \"Sleep disorders\".\n\nThe text description of patient AII-11 on page 3 (\"Clinical Presentation\") mentions: \"Patient AII-11 was a 77-year-old man who developed right upper limb rest tremor at age 62. At age 75, he underwent gastrostomy for progressive dysphagia, then developed cognitive dysfunction without hallucination.\" This description does not mention sleep disorders.\n\nTherefore, based only on the information contained within the provided document, it cannot be determined if patient AII-11 has sleep disorders.\n\nInformation not found"
