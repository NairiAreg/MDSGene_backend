  "raw_answer": "Information not found.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  Patient 'AII-11' is identified as the proband in Family A (Figure 1A).\n2.  AII-11 is affected and carries the p.D620N mutation (Table 1 shows \"VPS35 p.D620N A\"; Table 2 lists AII-11 as a patient with the mutation).\n3.  Figure 1A shows other affected individuals in Family A:\n    *   Generation I: Individual 1 (I-1) - affected, not asterisked (not stated if analyzed).\n    *   Generation II: Individuals 1, 3, 6, 8, 12 - all affected.\n        *   II-1, II-3, II-6, II-8: not asterisked (not stated if analyzed).\n        *   II-12: affected and asterisked (analyzed for p.D620N mutation and/or haplotype, per Fig 1 legend).\n    *   Generation III: Individual 1 (III-1) - affected and asterisked (analyzed).\n4.  The question asks how many *affected* individuals in Family A have *wildtype* (no mutations).\n5.  While affected individuals AII-12 and AIII-1 were analyzed (indicated by asterisks in Figure 1A), the document does not explicitly state the results of their p.D620N mutation analysis. It only states they were \"analyzed\". The text on page 3 mentions \"One disease allele was detected by analyzing patient AII-11 and his relatives,\" but it doesn't specify which relatives or their individual mutation status.\n6.  For the other affected individuals (I-1, II-1, II-3, II-6, II-8), they are not marked as analyzed, so their mutation status is unknown from this document.\n7.  Since the document does not provide the specific mutation status (mutated or wildtype) for any *other* affected and analyzed members of Family A (besides AII-11 who has the mutation), we cannot determine how many affected individuals in this family have the wildtype.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': How many affected individuals in the family have wildtype (no mutations)?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'AII-11' from family 'Family A': How many affected individuals in the family have wildtype (no mutations)?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
