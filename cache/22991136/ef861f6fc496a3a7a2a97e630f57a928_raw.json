  "raw_answer": "The document states that 7 nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35 were screened for in patients. These are listed on page 2 under \"Genetic Analysis\": p.M571, p.I241M, p.P316S, p.R524W, p.D620N, p.A737V, and p.L774M.\n\nPatient CII-3 from Family C was found to have the p.D620N mutation (Table 1, page 3; Figure 1C, page 3).\n\nThe document states:\n1.  In the Abstract: \"The p.D620N mutation was detected in 3 patients with autosomal dominant PD... None of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected.\"\n2.  On page 3, under Results: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" And \"The remaining variants analyzed in this study were not identified in any patients.\"\n\nThis means that patient CII-3 was found to have the p.D620N mutation, but none of the other 6 screened variants, nor any other variants in all exons of VPS35. Therefore, patient CII-3 is described as having only one specific variant (p.D620N) in the VPS35 gene. The document does not describe a \"first,\" \"second,\" or \"third\" distinct pathogenic variant found in patient CII-3.\n\nIf \"the third variant\" refers to the third variant in the list of 7 variants screened for in the study (p.P316S), the document states that this variant (and others besides p.D620N) was *not* detected in any patients, including CII-3. Therefore, information about the type of \"the third variant\" *as present in patient CII-3* cannot be provided because patient CII-3 does not have it.\n\nSince patient CII-3 is only reported to have the p.D620N mutation and no other variants in VPS35, there is no information about a \"third variant\" for this patient.\n\nInformation not found.",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What type of mutation is the third variant?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What type of mutation is the third variant?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
