  "raw_answer": "Based on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document states on page 3: \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\" Patient CII-3 is listed as having the p.D620N mutation (Table 1 and Table 2). Therefore, a \"second mutation\" for patient CII-3 in the VPS35 gene was not identified in this study.\n\nFurthermore, the term \"gnomAD\" (or Genome Aggregation Database) is not mentioned anywhere in the document. The frequency data discussed pertains to the study's own control group or frequencies from other cited publications, not gnomAD.\n\nTherefore, the gnomAD v2.1.1 frequency for a second mutation for patient 'CII-3' is:\nInformation not found",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the gnomAD v2.1.1 frequency for the second mutation?",
  "context": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document, answer the following question:\n\nRegarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What is the gnomAD v2.1.1 frequency for the second mutation?\n\nIf the information is not found in the document, state 'Information not found'."
