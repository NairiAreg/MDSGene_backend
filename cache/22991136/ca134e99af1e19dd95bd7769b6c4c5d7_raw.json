  "raw_answer": "Based *only* on the information contained within the provided document:\n\nThe document states the following:\n1.  In the Abstract: \"We screened 7 reported nonsynonymous missense variants of VPS35, including p.D620N... The p.D620N mutation was detected in 3 patients with autosomal dominant PD... None of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected.\"\n2.  In the Results section, under \"Detection of p.D620N Mutation\" (page 3): \"Patients carrying the p.D620N mutation did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35.\"\n3.  Table 1 (\"Haplotype analysis of VPS35 p.D620N mutation carriers\") shows that patient 'CII-3' has the \"A/G\" genotype for \"VPS35 p.D620N\", indicating they carry the p.D620N mutation.\n\nSince patient CII-3 carries the p.D620N mutation, and the document explicitly states that patients carrying this mutation \"did not have any other variants in all exons of VPS35\" and that \"None of the other reported variants of VPS35 were detected,\" the document does not provide information about a \"second variant\" (mutation) for patient CII-3.\n\nTherefore, the type of mutation for a second variant for patient 'CII-3' cannot be determined from the provided document.\n\nInformation not found",
  "question": "Regarding patient 'CII-3' from family 'Family C': What type of mutation is the second variant?",
