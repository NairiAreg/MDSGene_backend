# Code Improvements Documentation

This document outlines the improvements made to the codebase to address potential issues and enhance the overall quality of the system.

## 1. VectorStoreProcessor Format Answer Consistency

### Issue
The `VectorStoreProcessor`'s `format_answer` method was not formatting answers according to the provided strategy, unlike `GeminiProcessor` which formats explicitly.

### Improvements
- Enhanced `format_answer` method in `VectorStoreProcessor` to perform basic formatting checks similar to `GeminiProcessor`
- Added handling for null/empty values and common phrases indicating missing information
- Implemented basic formatting logic based on strategy hints (numeric, yes/no, sex)
- Improved logging to provide better visibility into the formatting process

### Benefits
- Consistent output formatting between different processors
- More reliable handling of edge cases
- Better user experience with standardized responses

## 2. Cache Key Management

### Issue
Cache keys were generated only based on the query text, risking collisions if queries repeat across multiple documents or PMIDs.

### Status
The system already had a robust implementation:
- `generate_cache_identifier` method includes PMID in the cache key when available
- Cache files are stored in PMID-specific directories
- The implementation ensures cache keys are unique across documents/PMIDs

## 3. Robustness of DocumentProcessor Fallbacks

### Issue
When the vector store service fails, the fallback to direct FAISS usage might silently fail or cause confusion.

### Improvements
- Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff for vector store service calls
- Enhanced logging with detailed information about retry attempts and fallback scenarios
- Added traceback printing for critical errors
- Improved error messages to clearly indicate when fallbacks are being used

### Benefits
- More resilient system that can recover from temporary service failures
- Better visibility into what's happening when things go wrong
- Easier troubleshooting with more detailed error information

## 4. Configurable Constants

### Issue
Hardcoded configuration values like URLs and chunk sizes make it difficult to adjust settings without modifying code.

### Improvements
- Moved configuration constants to environment variables with sensible defaults:
  - `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: Base URL for Ollama service
  - `EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME`: Name of the embedding model to use
  - `TIMEOUT_EMBEDDING_SECONDS`: Timeout for embedding requests
  - `CHUNK_SIZE`: Size of text chunks for document splitting
  - `CHUNK_OVERLAP`: Overlap between text chunks

### Benefits
- Easier configuration for different environments
- No need to modify code to adjust settings
- More flexible deployment options

## Usage Instructions

### Environment Variables

You can customize the behavior of the system by setting the following environment variables:

```
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=mxbai-embed-large
TIMEOUT_EMBEDDING_SECONDS=60
CHUNK_SIZE=500
CHUNK_OVERLAP=100
```

These can be set in a `.env` file in the project root or as system environment variables.

### Fallback Behavior

The system will now attempt to retry failed vector store service calls before falling back to direct FAISS usage. This provides more resilience against temporary service outages.

If you see messages about fallbacks being used, check that the vector store service is running correctly.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Phase out direct FAISS loading**: Consider eventually removing direct FAISS access after ensuring the vector store service is reliable, to reduce complexity and potential synchronization issues.

2. **Standardize logging**: Implement a consistent logging framework across all components with appropriate log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and structured log entries.

3. **Add monitoring**: Consider adding monitoring and alerting for fallback scenarios to proactively address service issues.
